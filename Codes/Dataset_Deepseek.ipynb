His brain has been donated for research on what\\u2019s known as super-aging.ByAlex WilliamsMorrie Markoff, a supercentenarian blogger and scrap-metal sculptor who was believed to be the oldest man in the United States and whose brain has been donated for research on what is known as super-aging, died on June 3 at his home in downtown Los Angeles. He was 110.He had two strokes in recent weeks, his daughter, Judith Markoff Hansen, said in confirming his death.People who live to be 110 or older are considered supercentenarians, and the Gerontology Research Group, in Los Angeles, listsmore than 150 of themaround the world.Mr. Markoff, who was born in New York City on Jan. 11, 1914, six months before World War I began, joined the club this year and was regarded as the oldest living man in the United States after the death in January ofFrancis Zouein, at 113, in California.As of April, theoldest living manin the world is believed to beJohn Alfred Tinniswood, of England, at 111, according to Guinness World Records. (Guinness listsMar\\u00eda Branyas Morera, a California native who lives in Spain, as the oldest woman in the world, at 117.)When Mr. Markoff heard the news of his rise to the top of the list, \\u201cHe just smiled and said, \\u2018Well, someone\\u2019s got to be there,\\u2019\\u201d his daughter said in an interview.\",\n          \"Supported byMy Date Recorded Us Having Sex Without My Consent. Should I Report Them?ByKwame Anthony AppiahI went on a date with someone, and we went back to their apartment. In the middle of sex, I caught this person, who uses they/them pronouns, recording me on their phone. For my safety, I chose to pretend I did not notice, as I did not want to be stranded in the middle of the night. In the morning, I confronted them, and they apologized and deleted the video. They said that was their first time recording someone during sex and a spur-of-the-moment decision, albeit a bad one.When I arrived home I felt more dehumanized than angry, as if I were a sex toy. I told my friends what happened, and they were very upset, and urged me to file a police report. I dismissed this at first, but I looked online and found that capturing imagery of a person\\u2019s private parts without their consent, when there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, is a violation of state and federal laws.I decided to contact my date and inform them of the gravity of their actions and told them never to do it again. I also decided that I didn\\u2019t want to press charges. I do not want to subject myself to a lengthy legal process, repeating and reliving this story over and over, as well as having to tell my family or put my life on hold. My friends are concerned that I don\\u2019t feel upset enough, and they assume that this was not my date\\u2019s first time recording someone, and will not be the last. They think I should file a police report to prevent my date from recording others in the future. I chose to assume that my date is a normal human being who made a stupid decision and does not necessarily deserve a criminal record because of it.

I told my friends what happened, and they were very upset, and urged me to file a police report.

I also decided that I didn\\u2019t want to press charges.

observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources. people who still have very sharp memory into old age known as \\\"superagers\\\" may get their impressive powers from certain areas of the brain being preserved. brain structures known as white matter usually decline in integrity with age, but in superagers, white matter remains structurally sound, according to a new paper in the journal of neuroscience. this may be the reason for superagers having the memory powers of people 30 years their junior, the researchers suggest. the brain is made up of gray matter and white matter, with gray matter being found on the brain's surface and white matter making up much of the deeper layers of the brain. white matter is made up largely of nerve fibers that are covered in a fatty substance called myelin, which helps to increase the speed and efficiency of electrical communication between neurons. the primary function of white matter is to connect different gray matter brain regions and transmit nerve signals quickly across the nervous system. white matter is essential for the coordination of various brain functions, from motor control to learning. damage to the white matter can affect how the brain processes information and communicates with the rest of the body. in the paper researchers from spain's universidad polit\\u00e9cnica de madrid and the queen sofia foundation alzheimer centre studied the brain structure of older adults experiencing memory loss and those of superagers across a five year period. they discovered that superagers had better white matter microstructure than older people with declining memory. \\\"we studied the white matter structure of a large sample of 64 superagers over the age of 80 and 55 age matched typical older adults during 5 years with yearly follow ups showing evidence of slower age related changes in the brains of superagers especially in protracted maturation tracts, indicating resistance to age related changes,\\\" the researchers wrote in the paper. therefore, superagers may have white matter that is somehow resistant to being degraded with time, which helps them maintain their memory later in life. \\\"the better preservation of white matter microstructure in superagers relative to typical older adults supports resistance to age related brain structural changes as a mechanism underpinning the remarkable memory capacity of superagers,\\\" the researchers said. they hope that these results may help scientists figure out if white matter can be protected to stem the tide of age related memory loss and dementia. \\\"understanding the superager phenotype can provide insights into mechanisms of protection against age related memory loss and dementia,\\\" the researchers said. do you have a tip on a science story that newsweek should be covering? do you have a question about superagers? let us know via science@newsweek.com. jess thomson is a newsweek

so i\\u2019m only going to make one this year: write a blog post on the best books i read over the past year. first up, the book that has truly changed the way i think about health and aging. ok so i was super skeptical starting this book. peter attia is a doctor turned mckinsey consultant turned health guru who\\u2019s had his fair share of criticism (see this new yorker piece and this reddit post). he\\u2019s much lauded by bro culture he\\u2019s been interviewed by joe rogan and was on chris hemsworth\\u2019s nat geo series so my bs radar was on high. i expected a very commodified approach to health: eat this wonder food, use these weights, inject this supplement, take this drug, sign up for this bootcamp. and when you go to his website, that\\u2019s the business model. while some of that commodification comes through in the book and you can see why the gym bunnies love him he turns out to be an exceptional science and health journalist. he\\u2019s just wonderful at breaking down complex and wide ranging research into pithy paragraphs. he writes in an objective way that doesn\\u2019t skew the evidence, and you can really tell him and ihd team spend a lot of time looking through the literature and scrutinizing it. only occasionally does go through a bunch of evidence only to end with a pretty thin justification for trying a new drug that shows promise (and invariably turns out to be very expensive). his main premise is that modern healthcare is too focused on treatment, and by that stage, it\\u2019s invariably too late to have an impact. he calls this current healthcare system medicine 2.0. it focuses largely on lifespan, and is almost entirely geared toward staving off death. he wants to see a shift to a medicine 3.0 that pays far more attention to maintaining healthspan the quality of life  rather than just responding to chronic illness or spending a disproportionate amount of money and effort to often extend life by a few years after a serious episode of cardiac problems or cancer. to really maintain healthspan (i.e to be able to do the things you love when you\\u2019re in your 80s, 90s, or even 100s) you have to acknowledge how much your body deteriorates over time. if you anticipate those significant percentage decreases in stability, strength, mental acuity, and general bodily function, you can train to be above the minimum level of capability you\\u2019ll need later in life (e.g., get up without help, put a suitcase in the overhead, pick up your grandkid, not be scammed, or not be pulled over by your dog). that way, even with the inevitable deterioration, you\\u2019ll still be able to maintain a minimum ability to live a healthy life. some of the things he recommends can be a little \\u201cwell, duh\\u201d (being fat is bad for your health; sleep is good for you), but it\\u2019s illuminating to see that it\\u2019s really hard to back up some of these \\u201cduh\\u201d recommendations with rigorous evidence. evidence on the long term effects of things like nutrition, exercise, and sleep are notoriously difficult to gather. humans really are the least compliant study subjects. rigorously testing any hypothesis on this stuff through experimentation is stupidly expensive and takes too long for most funding cycles. some of the studies he mentions are both amazing (that scientists have managed to do anything!) and dumbfounding (that this is really the best we have on something so fundamental). i was brought up in large part by my grandmother a centenarian who stayed incredibly active and healthy well into her 90s. she really lived so much of this: she didn\\u2019t overeat, she barely drank alcohol, she had a strong community, she took sleep seriously, and she hit the gym consistently at 5 a.m. \\u2026and took rapamycin every day. ok, so you know which of those aren\\u2019t true, but maybe she\\u2019d have made it to the supercentenarian club if she had. \\ud83d\\ude09 this book is in the vein of anand giridharadas\\u2019s winners take all. schiller a journalist, academic, and fundraising consultant brings a deep understanding of the current philanthropy landscape and the history of how it evolved into what it is today. if you only read it for one thing, the sections on philanthropy in ancient rome, greece, and the gilded age are worth it. schiller is super critical of the current roi focused, lifesaving, and poverty fighting efforts championed by organizations like the bill & melinda gates foundation, robin hood, and the proponents of effective altruism. her criticisms, though often insightful, can feel a little repetitive and oversimplified, lumping a lot of efforts together without fully engaging with what a counterfactual might look like. her solutions to philanthropy\\u2019s current problems can be a little thin, but her closing arguments are compelling. she advocates for making philanthropy accessible to everyone not just the wealthy by reforming tax policies (e.g., changing the deduction to a credit or implementing a progressive sliding scale) and regulating donor advised funds to prevent tax avoidance. she also argues for raising the minimum wage, pointing out that the poor have always given to charity often more generously than the rich but it has become increasingly difficult for them to do so effectively. there\\u2019s a huge appetite for easier ways to give, as evidenced by the rise in interest in effective altruism and platforms like gofundme. schiller suggests that doers themselves would probably jump at the chance to be less beholden to a few funders. the tale of tiger woods is oft told a precocious child who basically emerged from the womb holding a golf club. he practiced endlessly and achieved greatness through perseverance, specialization, and dedication. golf, golf, golf! the story of roger federer is less well known. he had a casual interest in a succession of sports skiing, basketball, soccer only eventually focusing on tennis in his teens, which left him starting well behind his peers. epstein argues that we can learn a lot more about achieving excellence from roger than from tiger. we often focus on narrow games like golf and chess as analogues to life, but games like tennis and poker where luck plays a role and success requires responding to an opponent in real time are better teachers. they show how bringing in broad knowledge and diverse skills can help you achieve greatness. (see thinking in bets by annie duke if you want to learn what poker can teach you about decision making.) we\\u2019re indoctrinated to believe that \\u201ca jack of all trades is a master of none.\\u201d i think it\\u2019s culturally telling that we habitually chop off the end of the original phrase: \\u201ca jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.\\u201d this book tells the story of the harvard study of adult development the longest running study of happiness and well being ever conducted. spanning over 80 years, it\\u2019s one of the most valuable scientific resources we have on what makes for a good life. it\\u2019s also a reminder of how recent large scale experimentation really is, and how much more we could learn with broader, long term studies that include more diverse populations. one of the most fascinating parts is seeing how the methodology and questions evolved over time. for instance, one of the original questions was, \\u201care you ticklish?\\u201d and they kept asking it for 40 years, just in case. spoiler alert: the good life? it\\u2019s a complicated one. for everyone. as the study reveals: \\u201cone thing the large body of research into human flourishing clearly shows from our longitudinal study and from dozens of others is that it doesn\\u2019t matter how old you are, where you are in the life cycle, whether you are married or not married, introverted or extroverted; everyone can make positive turns in their life.\\u201d the study underscores that relationships aren\\u2019t just stepping stones to other things or functional routes to health and happiness they are ends in themselves. call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family: whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one. zen and buddhist principles subtly shine through the study\\u2019s findings: the value of the present moment, the wisdom of age, and the importance of connection things we often overlook in a media landscape dominated by the young. or the brash. read this and get some perspective. another world best science journalist, best known for his book the power of habit which brought a lot of

better start explaining some stuff.\\u201d and then read it. i also went to amsterdam for the first time and read this tightly plotted post war novel right after going to anne frank\\u2019s house. some great twists and i learned a lot about how badly returning jews were treated in holland after the war. ok so i am very late to this furore over a novel written by a white woman. it\\u2019s a good yarn   but honestly the reason i mention it as it put me onto lauren groff\\u2019s response in the nyt to the all the hoo ha. she\\u2019s my favorite. i\\u2019d read a review of a microwave by her. this is harrowing   the amount of times the protagonist, a servant girl who escapes abuse and plague in a new world settlement, gets injured is kinda ridiculous. it makes you squeem constantly and feel shame at how you would surely buckle at the constant challenges thrown at the girl in the wild. it\\u2019s exhilarating but stern, there\\u2019s no humour, but nor should there be. it would be unbearable in the hands of a lesser writer. groff manages to bring natural moments into the survival story that sustain you. maybe you would survive. you have to be a gifted writer if you can get me to read 300 pages about a nunnery in the 1100s. it tells the tale of eleanor of aquitaine, a lady banished from courtly france to an impoverished abbey in england. it shows her struggles to greatness and use of logic in a world generally crippled by religion and superstition. if you loved hillary mantel\\u2019s cromwell, you\\u2019ll love her. and that\\u2019s all i\\u2019ve got time for this

time, with lots of real people in attendance). i got a new job. and, as ever, i didn\\u2019t read nearly as many books as i\\u2019d have liked to. but i did read some gems this year which really changed the way i think and had a profound impact on me. bury the chains: prophets and rebels in the fight to free an empire\\u2019s slaves by adam hochschild i\\u2019m a huge fan of hochschild. king leopold\\u2019s ghost is one of the most horrificly brilliant accounts of the brutality of colonialism. in this history of british abolitionism hochshild notes that ending slavery would have seemed as unlikely in eighteenth century england as banning automobiles does today, and that even those on the vanguard of abolitionism found advocating for freeing current slaves to be a step too far. he also shows that caribbean slavery was, by every measure, far more deadly than slavery in the american south. this was not because southern masters were the kind and gentle ones of gone with the wind, but because cultivating sugar cane by hand was and still is one of the hardest ways of life on earth. because of the extraordinarily low birth rate and the early deaths from disease, caribbean masters depended, far more so than planters in the american south, on a constant flow of new slaves. as cultural reference points of slavery increasingly focus on the american south, it is easy to forget how deadly the caribbean was for slaves, and how this was caused primarily by the british. his deft examination of the anti slavery movement is no hagiography, although the more you read about thomas clarkson, a committed quaker activist who who pioneered the use of petitions, eyewitness accounts, and even an early, innocent form of direct mail solicitation, the more you think he should be a household name and the more every campaigner should learn his story. in particular there are analogues to climate activism. at the heart of the capaign to abolish slavery there was a tension between the revolutionaries and those more conservative in nature. although radical in confronting a practice so interwoven with the economy of the empire and accepted throughout the world, the movement generally argued against slavery not in the name of a new social order, but rather as a continuation of christianity and british law. similarly today you see the tension between green advocates who want to upend the world order and those who see green technology as a continuation of the progress made under capitalism american midnight: the great war, a violent peace, and democracy\\u2019s forgotten crisis by adam hochschild did i mention i was a hochschild fanboy? in this book he examines the four years of american history from 1917 to 1921. the united states during that time saw a swell of patriotic frenzy and political repression rarely rivaled in its history. president woodrow wilson\\u2019s terror campaign against american radicals, dissidents, immigrants and workers makes the mccarthyism of the 1950s look almost subtle by comparison. as we go into a potentially defining election year, and possibly disastrous outcome, it is humbling to read that us democracy has survived some very dark days. gambling on development by stefan dercon oh how i wished i\\u2019d had this book ten years ago. the opening chapters beat any number of longer winded attempts at summarizing a swathe of development economics. he\\u2019s a punchy writer, and as former chief economist at the uk department for international development (dfid), a professor at oxford and, until recently, a policy adviser to the uk foreign secretary, you can tell he\\u2019s had a lot of practice at explaining complex topics to dummies. his big idea rest on the importance of elites and how they are required to mkae a bet on development if the wider economy is to flourish. \\u2018a development bargain is a specific form of elite bargain, one of many possible ones. it is an agreement among those with power that growth and development should be pursued, even if they disagree over policy details. countries with a development bargain tend to have three features in common: 1) the politics of the bargain are real and credible, not just some vague official statement or announcement; (2) the capabilities of the state are used to achieve the goals of the bargain, but, importantly, the state avoids doing more than it can handle; and (3) the state possesses a political and technical ability to learn from mistakes and correct course.\\u2019 basically, countries get the leaders their elites deserve. his argument is convincing, although he slightly struggles when it comes to explaining the composition of elites and how to better cultivate an elite group that is willing to a make a big bet on development. i found myself constantly thinking about the debate between access and quality in education, and how this impacts how elites would think about development. if you ascribe to a view that elites really are crucial, it becomes even more important to ensure that there is an education system that is getting elites highly literate and numerate. obviously the counter to that is that you need wider access to to education so that the elites can be drawn from a wider strata of society, but that seems naively optimistic on how egalitarian most societies are. merchants of doubt: how a handful of scientists obscured the truth on issues from tobacco smoke to global warming by naomi oreskes and erik m. conway the history of corporate financed public relations efforts to sow confusion and skepticism about scientific research is long, infuriating, but ultimately uplifting, as the vast majority of the time they fail. what you see is that most people do trust science on most things, and most people trust experts on most things. but the infuriating thing is that it only takes a few wrenches in the machine to really slow things down. most of the time we reject scientific findings because we don\\u2019t like their implications. it will make us do something inconvenient (i.e stop smoking with our friends, travel less, eat less delicious food). it\\u2019s why scientists have to be in the business of selling the better world that comes from their findings. going infinite: the rise and fall of a new tycoon by michael lewis this dude is always in the right place at the right time. he\\u2019s come in for some stick for not jamming in the knife deeper to sbf, but whatever this is a captivating adventure and as always his prose is just\\u2026mwa. billion dollar whale: the man who fooled wall street, hollywood, and the world by tom wright & bradley hope jho low is the villain late stage capitalism needs. this is the story of how he got through nearly $5 billion dollars in the 1mdb scandal. ok so this book does have a heavy dose of wealth porn and it you can\\u2019t help be captivated by the excess (britney jumping out of his birthday cake in a gold bikini!). the intriue comes from how many credible people wanted to believe  from swiss bankers to movie producers. it seems the only person who could tell straight out it was a fraud was jordan belfort (the actual wolf of wall street) who tried to warn leo dicaprio about them. secrets of sand hill road: venture capital and how to get it by skott kupor i just spent a year working in vc and this is the perfect primer for that world. i wish there was an equivalent handbook for the world of philanthropy. rogues: true stories of grifters, killers, rebels and crooks by patrick radden keefe one of the best staff writers at the new yorker has some of his best pieces collected in this book. he paints characters better than anybody. i love this anecdote from arthur koestler   he once pointed out that when thieves were hanged in the village square, other thieves flocked to the execution to pick the pockets of the spectators. a note of warning to anybody who thinks that extreme punishment is an effective deterrent. becoming trader joe: how i did business my way and still beat the big guys by joe coulombe trader joe\\u2019s is unlike any other american grocery store. in a very good way. in this you see how pig headed it required joe coulombe to be to not be shifted away from his mission to create a grocery store that treats it\\u2019s customers and employers right. and gives them both access to a better way of delivering fresh food to people. losing the signal: the untold story behind the extraordinary rise and spectacular fall of blackberry by jacquie mcnish and sean silcoff better than the recent movie. it\\u2019s so easy to forget how revolutionary the little keyboard was. hope everyone at google and apple reads this. a perfect demonstration on why you should rarely design an organization around a product. artemis: a novel by andy weir two reasons to love this book. one, kenya has become the preeminent nation in space exploration due to a savvy government and it\\u2019s shoter distance to the moon due to being close to the equator. and two, the epiogue chich napkin maths out the economics reuquired to make viable tourism industry and community on the moon is just brilliant. birnam wood: a novel by eleanor catton i read the illuminaries ten years ago and it stuck with me. catton has such a knack with plot. birnam wood is just as good. you start to think it\\u2019s going to turn into a bit of treatise on how hard it is to stay true to your morals as a revolutionary but it turns into storming corporate thriller. i dare you to read it in under 2 days. same as ever: a guide to what never changes by morgan housel the best blog writer out there condenses so much wisdom into this little book. read it in two hours and then read it again. history never repeats itself; man always does.  voltaire the wise in all ages have always said the same thing, and the fools, who at all times form the immense majority, have in their way, too, acted alike, and done just the opposite.  arthur schopenhauer the bill gates problem: reckoning with the myth of the good billionaire by tim schwab i wish this was better written. the lazy rhetorical questions and speculation overshadow some really important journalism. it\\u2019s hard to read the section on the links to epstein and not come out of it feeling very worried. i\\u2019m obsessed with football. i\\u2019d call it an addiction as i\\u2019ve tried to stop. but i can\\u2019t and i\\u2019m stuck with it. at elast it\\u2019s not baseball or some other sport that onyl one country cares about. at least it truly is an international game. i\\u2019m stuck with it so i figured this year i would buff up a bit and actually study it. the club: how the english premier league became the wildest, richest, most disruptive force in sports by joshua robinson and jonathan clegg there are so many wheeler dealer characters at the birth of the premier league. it\\u2019s a tale of how free markets can create a better product that brings value to so many more people. inverting the pyramid: the history of soccer tactics by jonathan wilson jonathan wilson is by far and away the best writer on football tactics out there. his weekly column in the guardian is unmatched. this minutely researched history, along with formations, of all the great sides of the past 150 years is masterclass. it also shows a hegelian view of how new tactics emerge. pep\\u2019s inversion of fullbacks can look like a complete revolution but when you see tactics from some of the teams of the 30s and 40s you see them do soemthing very similar. an important trick in everything: to develop foresight, you need to practice hindsight. the mixer: the story of premier league tactics, from route one to false nine by michael cox more focused on the recent game and a good reminder that the premier league has often not been great at learning from what is happening in the rest of the world. my autobiography: the autobiography of the legendary manchester united manager by alex ferguson the greatest. he did it simply and in this book you can see his obsession but also his clarity. never one to mince words this contains a lot of wisdom in a short book. ayoade on top by richard ayoade it takes remarkable skill to write a book based on the gwyneth paltrow 2003 movie view from the top. paltrow herself called it \\u201cthe worst movie ever\\u201d. the year russia invaded ukraine. the year the pandemic seemed to be on the wane. the year that trump\\u2019s hold on the republican party seemed to be slipping. the year i read fewer books than i had hoped to read, much like every year. first up the best book to read if you want to get some context on the war in ukraine and understand why the ukrainians will fight to the bitter end (and why we should back them with everything we\\u2019ve got). it\\u2019s hard to fathom the 1930\\u2019s and 1940\\u2019s in ukraine. snyder does terrifyingly terrific job of accounting the atrocities that are often glossed over in light of more easily visualized narratives. american and british forces reached none of the bloodlands and saw none of the major killing sites. it is not just that american and british forces saw none of the places where the soviets killed, leaving the crimes of stalinism to be documented after the end of the cold war and the opening of the archives. it is that they never saw the places where the germans killed, meaning that understanding of hitler\\u2019s crimes has taken just as long. the majority of the history we learn of that period in the west is still clouded by that lack of observation. he shows that for both hitler and stalin, ukraine was more than a source of food. it was the place that would enable them to break the rules of traditional economics, rescue their countries from poverty and isolation, and remake the continent in their own image. their programs and their power all depended upon their control of ukraine\\u2019s fertile soil and its millions of agricultural laborers. putin is no different. the main lesson of this book is that the human capacity for subjective victimhood is apparently limitless, and people who believe that they are victims can be motivated to perform acts of great violence. you want to get some understanding of being muslim in a post 9/11 america? read this book. you want to laugh, cry, and be bewildered by the immigrant experience? read this book. you want to understand the allure of trump to people who should never vote for him? read this book. the most hilarious thing about this book is that it was picked as a book of the year by obama and one can only really read the book as a searing indictment of his administration   the erosion of truth, decency and hope in a nation shaped by debt and money. walter isaacson played a huge role in the beatification of saint steve jobs. i loved his biography as much as the next bro. this book does a much better job of showing the vast tapestry of humans needed to bring about the progress we often misattribute to such a small number of people. from ada lovelace to vannevar bush to alan turing to grace hopper to stewart brand to al gore this book is full of portraits of talent that have brought about the greatest couple of hundred years of technological progress. as einstein once said, \\u201ca new idea comes suddenly and in a rather intuitive way, but intuition is nothing but the outcome of earlier intellectual experience.\\u201d it also shows repeatedly that computer innovators, like other pioneers, can find themselves left behind if they get stuck in their ways. the same traits that make them inventive, such as stubbornness and focus, can make them resistant to change when new ideas come along. we\\u2019re already seeing that with those who are leaping at new ways of working with ai and those who are too hesitant. i went to nepal this summer. a very different nepal to the one described in this 1978 book by peter matthiessen. his account of his two month search for the snow leopard with naturalist george schaller is a well feted travel book. and although much of it has not aged well (some of the prose about \\u201chis sherpas\\u201d is downright disgusting by modern standards) it is still a beautiful meditation on death, suffering, and healing and how travel can help you gain peace within yourself. and how adversity makes you stronger. reading this while traveling around nepal with the aid of the internet made me long for the difficulty and uncertainty of traveling in a less informed time. whatever you think about taleb the public intellectual (it\\u2019s hard not to hate him on twitter!), his books are full of wisdom. basically this is a long treatise on the golden rule   treat others the way you would like them to treat you   and the more robust silver rule that says \\u201cdo not treat others the way you would not like them to treat you\\u201d. if you don\\u2019t know the lindy effect, look it up. not everything that happens happens for a reason, but everything that survives survives for a reason. parables are better at teaching lessons about complex ethics than most ny times best sellers. hamid has the knack for tight writing that doesn\\u2019t take a great concept too far. a transformative couple of hours reading. humans are animals. like it or not. humans are apes. like it or not. apes display a lot of different behaviors. and we have a lot to learn from them. all of them, from chimps to bonobos. like it or not. de waal is the don of primatolgists. you wanna understand different hierarchies? read this book. you wanna understand the huge variety of gender roles within most ape communities? read this book. but as the american reproductive biologist milton diamond is fond of saying, \\u201cnature loves variety. unfortunately, society hates it.\\u201d this book from 1981 chronicles the experiences of a computer engineering team racing to design a next generation computer at a blistering pace under tremendous pressure. in \\u201dliterature and science,\\u201d a slim book published almost 20 years ago, aldous huxley tried to discern ways in which literary artists might come to grips with the accelerating scientific and technological revolution. modern writers, he observed, have shown little enthusiasm for science, and less for engineering. although they have been concerned with \\u201dthe social and psychological consequences of advancing technology,\\u201d they have been very little interested in technology itself. the making of machinery has not aroused   in either writers or readers   the \\u201dpassionate interest\\u201d that lies at the heart of creative literature. looking to the future, however, huxley was more optimistic. he viewed the difficulties inherent in wedding science to literature as a challenge to intellectual combat. \\u201dthe conceptual and linguistic weapons,\\u201d he said, \\u201dwith which this particular combat must be waged have not yet been invented. \\u2026 but sooner or later the necessary means will be discovered.\\u201d as the years have passed, there has been little indication that huxley\\u2019s optimism was well founded. science, perhaps, has inspired a few works of poetic insight; but technology, increasingly complex and impersonal, appears to be drifting ever farther away from the domain of serious literature. there is science fiction, of course, but it is usually written as entertainment and set in the distant future. the other genre that has blown up recently is of the technological fraud (think bad blood and billion dollar loser). but i\\u2019ve yet to read anything that really gets under the skin of what it takes to bring about technological change as well as kidder does in this book. open to recommendations! most interviews suck. person a asks person b some pro forma questions that person b has prepared answers for. it mainly tests people\\u2019s script memorization and delivery, not how they think or how they behave in their regular life. tyler cowen is a contrarian and one of the best talent spotters out there. he started emergent ventures which funds early talent, is the head of the mercatus center with 200 employees, and has interviewed hundreds of people at the top of their field for his podcast conversations with tyler. his latest book talent written with daniel gross   a talent connoisseur in his own right, founder at yc, angel investor, and founder at pioneer, an upstart vc firm based in sf   shows a better way to conduct interviews. here\\u2019s some of their rules for more revealing interviews: establish common ground. don\\u2019t try to trip the other person up. ask personal questions that you really want to know the answer to. avoid phoniness and the long list of prepared pro forma questions about the job. scrap the \\u201cwhat\\u2019s your weakness?\\u201d question. it is hard to fake an entire story on the fly. something as simple as \\u201chow did you spend your morning today?\\u201d can elicit really interesting answers. go to a coffee shop, a restaurant, or for a walk. it lets you see how somebody responds to unexpected change and makes it easier to be more conversational and less protective. you want to find something about their true nature, not something they have well prepared. questions like \\u201cwhat are ten words your partner or best friend would use to describe you?\\u201d or \\u201cwhat did you like to do as a child?\\u201d are hard to prepare for but easy to answer honestly. and their current favorite question: what are the open tabs on your browser right now? have you heard the old fundraising adage that \\u201cif you want advice, ask for money. if you want money, ask for advice\\u201d? it\\u2019s funny, a little depressing, and mainly true. i\\u2019ve been in hundreds of first time meetings between funders and social entrepreneurs. the successful conversations feel effortless. they\\u2019re like a couple of tennis pros doing a warm up rally. curiosity from both sides keeps the ball whizzing back and forth. nobody is trying to land a killer blow, they are trying to see how much the other can handle comfortably. make them feel smart. you\\u2019re not trying to bamboozle them. use plain matter of fact language and comparisons that you\\u2019re sure they\\u2019ll know. don\\u2019t get too technical or grandiose. if they\\u2019ve funded something similar before, that can be a great starting point. send them a clear, short pre read to get them up to speed. tell the truth. it\\u2019s tempting to go into pitch mode and just keep throwing stuff at the funder in the hope that something sticks. this is playing dodgeball. it makes the funder want to pick holes in what you\\u2019re saying. this path invariably leads to bullshit. be candid. if you can\\u2019t be candid don\\u2019t have the conversation yet. make your idea so good that you can just tell them about it. be irrepressible. this isn\\u2019t arrogance. and it has to be sincere. show the funder that you\\u2019re open to challenging questions and want to think through hard things with them. if they\\u2019re asking questions you\\u2019ve heard a million times before, let them know how your thinking has evolved over time alternatively you can reframe the question to be more interesting. ask unconventional questions. funders do these intro meetings all the time. make their life more interesting by asking something stimulating of them. nothing too left field but something challenging that will get them thinking. even better if it gets you useful info as well. some examples: what\\u2019s the best/worse thing about your funding? which of your criteria are least rational? what other ideas in the pipeline are you really excited/bored by? have you learned anything surprising or counter intuitive from your recent investments? and remember funders want you to succeed in these conversations. all you\\u2019re trying to convince them of at this point is that you\\u2019re a good bet. i went to a jam packed yoga class this morning. i was the only man in there. it\\u2019s not the first time that\\u2019s happened. lululemon has a lot to answer for \\ud83d\\ude42 i was terrified of yoga for years. i thought you had to either be a super flexible women or a sage burning eco warrior to get into it. you don\\u2019t. ryan giggs played over 600 times over 23 years for manchester united. he retired when he was 40 and attributes his lengthy career to yoga. he started yoga because of injury and according to him \\u201cyoga works not just your hamstrings, groin and quads but also your calves, glutes, lower back, neck, sides and core. it helps to prevent injuries and makes you more supple and flexible.\\u201d lebron and tom brady also swear by yoga. there\\u2019s a misnomer that you can be good or bad at yoga. yoga is not a sport. it\\u2019s a practice. i see men come into a yoga studio and get flustered because they are not as flexible as the women in there. nobody cares. you can just do you. anybody who tells you otherwise is doing it wrong. i worked in restaurants for many years. one of the greatest lessons i took away from my experience? it\\u2019s all about the customer, always, without exception. that doesn\\u2019t mean the customer is always right, but they always need to end up thrilled with their experience. they need to get kind, courteous service. there can\\u2019t be any bullshit. everything is communicated to them with minimal fuss. and with a smile. in high impact philanthropy, when it\\u2019s done well, it\\u2019s all about the people who deliver impact   the doers. always, without exception. doers are the ones doing the hard work. they\\u2019re the rarity. funders just give away money. funders sometimes assume that by dint of giving away money the doers will always be thrilled. they\\u2019re not. not by a long shot. for the doers to be thrilled, you need to be obsessed with their experience. if you have to exit, do it kindly and with plenty of notice. think about those amazing servers who make you feel great about paying your check and getting quickly out the door. they give you some warning, they do it with a smile, and they\\u2019re super grateful for you doing them a favor. that\\u2019s the last restaurant metaphor, i promise. it\\u2019s easy in philanthropy to get distracted, to overly focus on the source of the money and spend your time keeping them happy. don\\u2019t. i mean you gotta keep them happy but a hellavu lotta impact will   or should   do that. and to get that impact, it\\u2019s all about the doers. some of books i loved (and finished) this year. with a short review. that\\u2019s it. the ministry for the future by kim stanley robinson a heatwave kills 20 million in india and the climate crisis gets real. we need to start thinking way bigger if we\\u2019re going to tackle global warming and this book nails making the intangible future feel real. it\\u2019s not dystopian and is laced with optimism about our species ability to change. wilding: returning nature to our farm by isabella tree and eric schlosser large landholders in sussex give up on industrial farming and try to return their land to the wild. it makes you realise how much nature has been lost in the post war period   not just mass destructions of habitats and species, but knowledge about them. many of our \\u201ctraditional\\u201d ideas around what \\u201cwild\\u201d and \\u201cnatural\\u201d are have been totally wrong as they\\u2019ve used post industrial habitats as their reference point. the bucolic english landscape would have been a lot wilder and more full of bugs, birds and bees. it can happen again. the journalist and the murderer by janet malcolm the best true crime book since in cold blood   a hidden gem from the 90s. it\\u2019s the story of a journalist who gets himself embedded in the defence team of a murder suspect and then gets sued by the murder suspect for defamation after he publishes his true crime book. a very american tale that\\u2019s as much a soliloquy on what it means to be a journalist as it is a gripping did he do it murder mystery. if you liked the documentary or hbo adaptation of the staircase, you\\u2019ll love this. how to change your mind by michael pollan although i am by no means a psychedelic aficionado, i\\u2019ve followed the increasingly rigorous research into the lsd and other hallucinogens with glee. michael pollan in his typically lucid prose gives a graduate education into the increasingly obvious benefits that can come from a controlled journey deeper into your mind. much better than the netflix show. the great influenza: the story of the deadliest pandemic in history by john barry one that i wish i had read right at the beginning of the current pandemic although the death tolls of the spanish flu might have made it even harder to sleep. it caused at least fifty million deaths worldwide, and possibly as many as one hundred million. yet even that number understates the horror of the disease, a horror contained in other data. normally influenza chiefly kills the elderly and infants, but in the 1918 pandemic roughly half of those who died were young men and women in the prime of their life, in their twenties and thirties. it\\u2019s chock full of interesting facts about that period. not least the origins of the name \\u201cspanish flu\\u201d. spain actually had very few cases at the beginning of the pandemic and the virus almost certainly didn\\u2019t originate in spain. but spain was neutral during the war. that meant the government did not censor the press, and unlike french, german, and british newspapers which printed nothing negative, nothing that might hurt morale spanish papers were filled with reports of the disease, especially when king alphonse xiii fell seriously ill. the disease soon became known as \\u201cspanish influenza\\u201d or \\u201cspanish flu,\\u201d very likely because only spanish newspapers were publishing accounts of the spread of the disease that were picked up in other countries. thinking in bets: making smarter decisions when you don\\u2019t have all the facts by annie duke poker is a great game for honing your decision making process. for most people, it\\u2019s difficult to say \\u201ci\\u2019m not sure\\u201d in a world that values and, even, rewards the appearance of certainty. but professional poker players are comfortable with the fact that great decisions don\\u2019t always lead to great outcomes and bad decisions don\\u2019t always lead to bad outcomes. the best players resist \\u201cresulting\\u201d. antifragile: things that gain from disorder by nassim taleb \\u201csome things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty. yet, in spite of the ubiquity of the phenomenon, there is no word for the exact opposite of fragile. let us call it antifragile. antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. the resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better. this property is behind everything that has changed with time: evolution, culture, ideas, revolutions, political systems, technological innovation, cultural and economic success, corporate survival, good recipes (say, chicken soup or steak tartare with a drop of cognac), the rise of cities, cultures, legal systems, equatorial forests, bacterial resistance \\u2026 even our own existence as a species on this planet.\\u201d such an important concept for anybody trying to build something that will last. this is a great piece on how to apply the concept to life in general. calling bullshit: the art of skepticism in a data driven world by carl t. bergstrom and jevin d. west bullshit is \\u201cunclarifiable unclarity.\\u201d not only is the bullshitter\\u2019s prose unclear, but the ideas underlying it are so ill formed that it cannot possibly be clarified. if this book was mandatory in high school the us the world would be a better place. unclarifiable i know. reminds me of neil postman\\u2019s dictum, \\u201cat any given time, the chief source of bullshit with which you have to contend is yourself.\\u201d on writing by stephen king no one likes grammar. or writing. even writers it seems. they all complain about it. good writing is often about letting go of fear and affectation. and adverbs. every copywriter should read this book. dammit everybody who does any writing in their work should read it. made to stick by chip & dan heath to summarize, here\\u2019s the heath\\u2019s checklist for creating a successful idea: you\\u2019ll need a simple, unexpected, concrete credentialed, emotional story. luckily it also spells out succes. funny that. i had such high hopes for last year. 2020 eh? we\\u2019ve all missed out on so much. not being able to hug somebody at a funeral; having to resist squeezing the cheeks of babies; the smiles of strangers hidden behind masks; lines around the block for groceries   all these take a toll. my more benign struggle this year has been the inability to while away hours in coffee shops and libraries with dear books. now you might say you can easily replicate a coffee shop in your home. pour some luke warm coffee into a chipped mug, put on some smooth jazz, and voila   cafe maison is yours, without any of the pesky distractions. but it\\u2019s the distractions and unpredictability of coffee shops and libraries that make them such great places to get immersed in books. books are about people (most of the time). reading with people around you helps bring books to life. i realize i transpose prose (sorry!) onto the people around me. i\\u2019m not sure if i\\u2019m admitting to a complete lack of imagination or to a brilliant talent for creating ad hoc dramatizations featuring amateur actors in my head. without the beautiful strangers to bring books, especially novels, to life my input of books has greatly decreased this year. it might also have been the incessant doomscrolling, but i prefer to think it\\u2019s the lack of coffee shops. when you\\u2019re reading any book that tries to generalize on human behavior it helps so much to have people, real people in all their weirdness, around you. it keeps you honest. if the stuff you\\u2019re reading wouldn\\u2019t hold true for the person ordering a muffin or the person struggling to open the bathroom door then it\\u2019s probably not worth thinking too much about. my greatest reading experiences have been when i\\u2019ve been surrounded by people. reading poor economics or thinking fast and slow while sitting at the village square in the village i lived in the gambia made me engage with their words and arguments in a deeper way than i ever got from reading in my bedroom or library during college. well enough of that, here are the books that i read at cafe maison that stuck with me the most last year: both by gerd gigerenzer i first got turned on to these books when i was trying to understand the us healthcare system. i receive such different treatment here from doctors in the us compared to in the uk. the incentives are so skew whiff that every interaction takes forever and everything from pain meds to x rays gets overprescribed. these books show that most of medicine is bonkers and far too overly dependent on complex models that do a shitty job of making wise decisions and communicate intelligent courses of action to patients. gigerenzer (a psychologist by training, but so much more than that) shows how medical professionals approach risk and communicate that risk to to patients in patently absurd ways. the books are worth it alone for the distinction he makes between how to approach risk and uncertainty. risk: if risks are known, good decisions require logic and statistical thinking. uncertainty: if some risks are unknown, good decisions also require intuition and smart rules of thumb. by maria konnikova this is maria\\u2019s journey from psychology phd to professional poker player. it\\u2019s part anthropological study of elite poker players, part a test of decision making theory in the wild. she finds that as edward gibbon warned about as far back as 1794, that \\u201cthe laws of probability, so true in general, [are] so fallacious in particular\\u201d and that brute math is not enough to win at the table. poker players have it easy in some ways. they have so many opportunities for quick feedback. for those of us in professions where feedback is slower it\\u2019s easy to have an illusion of skill and never get called on it. i\\u2019m more inclined to nassim talib\\u2019s belief that we cannot use games as models of real life because in life, the rules derived from games can break down in unforeseen ways. it\\u2019s called the ludic fallacy. games are too simplified. life has all sorts of things it can throw at you to make your careful calculations useless. saying that, konnikova gives a great account of how the mess of life influences how you play the cards you\\u2019re dealt. it ends with this delightful buddhist proverb: a farmer loses his prize horse. his neighbor comes over to commiserate about the misfortune, but the farmer just shrugs: who knows if it is a misfortune or not. the next day, the horse returns. with it are twelve more wild horses. the neighbor congratulates the farmer on this excellent news, but the farmer just shrugs. soon, the farmer\\u2019s son falls off one of the feral horses as he\\u2019s training it. he breaks a leg. the neighbor expresses his condolences. the farmer just shrugs. who knows. the country declares war and the army comes to the village, to conscript all able bodied young men. the farmer\\u2019s son is passed over because of his leg. how wonderful, the neighbor says. and again the farmer shrugs. perhaps. by william shirer this is not a recommendation. don\\u2019t read a 500 page opus on the makings of a totalitarian fascist system while there is a parody of a dictator is trying to win/steal an election. it will do nothing for your blood pressure. even if it is one of the most impressive pieces of journalism ever written. shirer seems like he was always at the right (or wrong depending how you look at it) place in europe at the right time. the us is not weimar but it takes very little imagination to mirror the way hitler hoodwinked so many with what trump has achieved these past 4 years. i took solace throughout the year that trump had not seriously tried to start a reichstag fire and that the generals of this

about in history in school was world war 2 over and over again. as the last survivors of that conflict pass us by, it feels even more imperative today that kids in this country are given an incessant

magnificent and terrible: the spasmodic drone of enemy aircraft overhead; the thunder of gunfire, sometimes close sometimes in the distance; the illumination, like that of electric trains in peace

for sharing! by: lisa kays, msw is it necessary to prevent therapists from using facebook any more than it would be to tell them that they can\\u2019t go out to dinner for fear of running into a client? what, exactly, is the difference? as a 30 something msw student, i find that facebook, linkedin, and twitter have become some of my primary methods of communication with former and current colleagues, family, and friends. i am, therefore, affected by this issue in a different way from people of previous generations who didn\\u2019t have such early exposure to the internet or don\\u2019t communicate as much via social media. likewise, my experience differs from that of the msw student who will enroll in 10 years, having never known a past that wasn\\u2019t logged online. the internet gained popularity when i was in my early 20s. i joined facebook in 2007 at the suggestion of my employer, to help promote the organization\\u2019s work. despite this later start, there is a lot about me online, as is true for many of us, because once the internet evolved, it became standard practice to post various types of information, from professional bios to wedding announcements. a google search will reveal that i served in the peace corps, teach improv, and do communications consulting. you could find that i\\u2019ve written an article about an abba cover band. and, now, that i wrote this one. these are not things i would likely share with a client in a therapy session. and yet, most people my age or younger will be unable to escape such exposure to some degree by the time they enroll in an msw program. begging the question, is the \\u201cblank slate\\u201d therapist even possible in the internet age? logging in to the dilemma in my first field placement, i didn\\u2019t have to consider any of this. i didn\\u2019t use my last name with clients because of the nature of the setting, and they were unlikely to have access to the internet. however, in my current placement, i\\u2019m forging longer term relationships with clients, all of whom have internet access and are likely to use social media. my question related to this issue centers primarily on dual relationships or harm to clients through therapist self disclosure. although informal discussions of this have occurred among professionals (scarton, 2010), little empirical research exists, but more is forthcoming, such as a recent study of online contact between therapists and clients (kolmes, 2011). the ethical web in reviewing the nasw code of ethics, i found that some of the most relevant ethical dimensions of this discussion focus on the following issues. do no harm. this principle asserts that when faced with dilemmas, social workers should endeavor always to choose the option that decreases or prevents harm (dolgoff, loewenberg, & harrington, 2009). this value asks that we explore what level of harm exists for clients when therapists use social media and under what conditions they should be used or not used. although there is limited research on this, literature on self disclosure and the alliance provides insight. first, it is well established that the therapeutic relationship is one of the most complex and important aspects of psychotherapy (glassgold, 2007). this is not an issue to be treated lightly. clients may prefer to think of their therapists as existing only in the therapy space. potential harm may occur, then, when the client feels impinged upon by finding a therapist\\u2019s personal information online (scarton, 2010). in one case, a patient experiencing erotic transference saw pictures online of his therapist in a bathing suit and was unable to continue treatment (scarton, 2010). further, a situation may be created in which the therapist must decide whether to accept \\u201cfriend\\u201d requests, potentially having to reject the client. unlike running into a client at a restaurant, then, this forces a therapist to state who can access his or her social world (scarton, 2010). blogs by therapy patients about this topic cite concerns about confidentiality, learning things they don\\u2019t want to know about the therapist, entangling boundaries, and having more difficulty letting go of the attachment after termination (tressugar, 2010). further, all eight commenters on one post agreed that they wouldn\\u2019t want an online relationship with their therapists (tressugar, 2010). commenters on a related post said it would feel \\u201cawkward\\u201d or \\u201ccreepy\\u201d to find information about one\\u2019s therapist (imaginenamaste, 2009). alternatively, some theorists propose that the potential damage of finding therapists online would not be as great as many think, and it could even be beneficial, arguing that twitter and facebook allow therapists to share information about psychotherapy (scarton, 2010). this could also help reduce stigma. one writer argues that some approaches to boundaries including via the internet are \\u201covercautious or rigid in their interpretation and therapeutic limits\\u201d (glassgold, 2007, p. 979). mcwilliams cites research showing that some self disclosure is inevitable and can enhance treatment, because \\u201coutcome is much more highly correlated with an attachment to a vivid individual person than with the application of any specific techniques\\u201d (2004, p. 182). one could certainly argue that some information about the therapist could set in motion certain transferential aspects of therapy that may be beneficial to the client if worked through. however, the danger, as in the above example, is that the information may be so threatening that the client leaves treatment. i also wonder, given how frequently social media is mentioned by clients, about the wisdom of therapists shutting themselves out of a very widespread and increasing part of our social fabric. however, it remains unclear whether there are ways for therapists to engage online and minimize harm and the extent to which they need to prioritize this to protect clients and the therapeutic alliance. some methods might include high privacy settings, limitations to certain sites, not directly interacting with clients, or limiting content posted. unfortunately, there are currently few guidelines to help inform decision making in this realm, as well as in terms of questions as to the responsibility of therapists given the possibility of even private sites being hacked and exposed, or information being visible unintentionally via networks. as one physician stated, \\u201cit\\u2019s more important for us to be a bit more careful about who we friend and who we don\\u2019t friend\\u201d (foreman, 2010). related ethical questions ask us to extend this to also consider to what degree therapists are responsible for protecting their information. quality of life. this value asks us to consider whether social media enhances the quality of life \\u201cfor all people\\u201d (dolgoff, 2009, p. 68). this would affect whether or not social workers would want to publicly model the behavior of using it. unfortunately, there is no definitive knowledge that would indicate whether social media is a benefit or a bane for people, communities, or society as a whole. right to privacy and confidentiality. by nature, online relationships are not private. as relationships under observation, they can inherently infringe upon client confidentiality, indicating that direct online relationships between therapists and clients are inappropriate. however, this also encourages us to consider that, for therapists who do engage in online interactions with clients, it is critical to consider the importance of informed consent and related ethical practices. it should also go without saying that therapists should never post client information online, even anonymously. the prevalence of those doing so is surprising, as therapist susan giurleo points out, while also arguing that this isn\\u2019t a sign that therapists need to give up social media, but that they need to be more judicious in its use (2010). this value also points to the need for guidelines to be established to help social workers understand the ethical parameters of using social media. full disclosure. the value of \\u201cfull disclosure\\u201d states, \\u201ca social worker should make practice decisions that permit her to speak the truth and to fully disclose all relevant information to her client and to others\\u201d (dolgoff, 2009, p. 68), asking us to look at the extent to which it is necessary or appropriate to forewarn clients about a therapists\\u2019 online presence since it could become relevant if the client comes across it on purpose or accidentally. therefore, we may be wise to consider preparing policies or paperwork for clients that might disclose fully and make open to discussion how the therapist manages her online presence, the therapist\\u2019s boundaries related to social media, the nature of information available about the therapist online, and the implications of searching for such information to the therapeutic process. some practitioners have such mechanisms in place (scarton, 2010). why am i all a twitter?: the personal perspective this framework helps clarify a complex ethical topic that has not yet been widely discussed or researched; however, it does not address the personal considerations of social workers such as myself who use and value social media. this will be of increasing importance as the younger generations who have hardly known an existence without social media take their place in the profession. we will need to grapple with this reality and with the differing attitudes about social media between the generations, particularly because social media is becoming more than an optional, \\u201cfun\\u201d outlet. it is rapidly becoming an integrated, primary means of conducting our social, civic, and professional lives. as one writer explained, \\u201csome therapists think total abstinence of social media is necessary. younger therapists tend to disagree, since the internet is so integral to their lives\\u201d (scarton, 2010). one ethicist expressed concern that younger therapists understand the internet very well, but may not understand the ethical and boundary issues that surround it (scarton, 2010). fair enough. but it also behooves us to consider the reality that the online existence of those younger therapists pre existed their decision to become therapists. and that their online existence is also how they participate in their communities, give to philanthropic causes, connect with friends, and advocate for policy change. i, for one, can\\u2019t imagine giving up social media. it is integral to my life. it is how i send, receive, and accept social invitations; participate in civic action, including policy advocacy; get my local, national, and international news; forge ties with out of state family and friends that i may not otherwise communicate with as regularly; exercise my sense of humor and creativity; share and receive information relevant to my life and interests; and keep up with professional trends and contacts. for this reason, it is my belief that as a social work student and aspiring therapist, it is my duty to find a way to interact with social media in a way that is respectful and mindful of my clients and my profession as a whole. as a result, i locked down my twitter account and hid my facebook profile in search. i find myself doing more self censoring of information i post, not because it would violate confidentiality or be overtly inappropriate, but because i am now more mindful that the joke i was making may be misconstrued or cause misunderstandings that might reflect poorly on the social work profession. i deleted my personal blog. however, these actions were not without personal loss. i am a creative person. i greatly valued the ability to share my writing and thinking with others and to be part of the broader conversation the internet allows. i sorely miss being able to do so. further, locking down my twitter account and facebook profiles limited my ability to interact with others. new contacts were not able to find me, and fewer people could see and interact with my tweets. over time, i found this frustrating. after a few more months of careful consideration, i dropped my facebook security one level (i can now be seen in search), a decision i continue to struggle with. i also recently opted to close my twitter account and open another under an anonymous moniker. however, i do identify myself as an msw student, to foster networking with other social workers and social work students tweeting about issues of common interest. i decided that the value for me in being able to network and share ideas, as well as the sense of fun and play i find through such interactions, weighed heavily enough for me to take this risk. i am also mindful each time i post that, although unlikely, it could be traced back to me if someone were extremely committed to doing so. this process has been, for me, very much an exploration of my own boundaries, as well as my therapeutic ones. it has raised the question for me not only of the ethical parameters of social media use in regard to how we work with and have an impact on our clients, but also their relevance to our own lives. conclusion given the saturation of social media in our lives, it may be necessary to ask every msw student to engage in some sort of education around social media and its implications for their new professional role. this might occur as part of the ethics course or even clinical practice courses. this would allow new social workers to explore such issues and their implications in depth and to understand the risks and benefits associated with their use of social media. it would also give them the information necessary to make informed decisions that resonate with their personal and professional values. just as we write papers to process our feelings about race and gender, it may soon be necessary to ask students to process their feelings about their use of social media. i know that doing so for me has been a crucial step in my professional development. in our studies of ethics, we are taught that, \\u201ccodes of ethics generally provide guidance only for good/bad decisions. they are far less effective in helping practitioners make decisions of the good/good and bad/bad variety\\u201d (dolgoff, 2009, p. 37). it is becoming increasingly clear that use of social media by social workers is rapidly evolving into the latter variety, given that action on either side has consequences for clients and therapists alike, and for their relationships inside and outside the therapy session. we do not yet have enough information about these potential consequences. unfortunately, the drumbeat of tweets isn\\u2019t slowing down to wait for us to figure it out. it is understood and within our code of ethics that we, as social workers, are to put client interests above our own. however, it is also understood that we are to practice self care and value human relationships (national association of social workers, 2008). as a profession, we are likely going to need to include these considerations as they apply to the lives and well being of our own practitioners in discussions about the ethical use of social media by those practitioners. undoubtedly, our hitting \\u201cpost\\u201d could potentially harm our relationships with our clients, but being unable to also imposes increasingly real costs to those who must refrain. not being on facebook doesn\\u2019t just mean not being able to play farmville anymore. it potentially means missing a valuable opportunity to connect. references dolgoff, r., loewenberg, f., & harrington, d.

assistant are important in supporting trust in therapeutic relationships. clinicians are responsible for establishing, maintaining, and, if necessary, restoring professional boundaries. according to the federation of state boards of physical therapy, a pt or pta, rather than a patient, is much more likely to cross professional and legal boundaries in clinical relationships. yet, situations of unwanted attention and inappropriate sexual behaviors from patients occur in physical therapist practice. log in or create a free account to keep reading. join apta to get unlimited access to content.

me. i was goofing around and said something, which to me was to tease them, and he told me, right there and then, not to say that again. my initial reaction was, \\u201coh? i thought we were playing,\\u201d and then later he told me why it was important that i didn\\u2019t repeat that. let me tell you, my respect for him shot. through. the. roof! it was through that encounter that i started paying special attention to and respecting the boundaries that people have, whether they voiced them or not. being with someone who proactively asked if they could call me an endearment, if they could text at a certain hour, or if they could even touch me, not only made me feel more secure but also rewired my mind to believe that yes, i do have control over how i am treated. a wise person (whose name i forgot) once said: boundaries are not there to chase you away; they are there to bring you closer. so, this article hopes to do just that: give you the tools and logs to help you begin building a hedge of boundaries around you, so that you can keep those you love close and the foxes at bay. boundaries are not telling the next person what to do. they are not a list or template of how people ought to treat you. and they are certainly not a 123 step guide on how to keep you happy. why? because you cannot force or control how the next person chooses to behave. boundaries are certain parameters you put in place to protect yourself. these can be emotional, spiritual, physical, and even financial. they look like they are telling someone that their actions have consequences. it\\u2019s the if/then solution to something that hurts, triggers, or makes you uncomfortable. for example, a boundary can be: \\u2018if you speak to me in such a tone again, then i will break up with you\\u2019. and, to make a boundary even qualify as one, you actually have to be prepared to stick to what you have stated. which, in this case, would be you walking away from the relationship if they raise their voice at you again. you have no control over whether they will take a tone with you again. but you know what you will do if they overstep. another example could be \\u2018if you don\\u2019t wash the dishes, then i will no longer cook\\u2019 or \\u2018if you take money from my purse, then i will report you to the police\\u2019. so, essentially, boundaries are responses you will take to a situation based on what someone does to you or how someone treats you, especially after they have been made aware not to do something. setting boundaries can seem as simple as saying you are no longer tolerating that close friend who gossips about others. but if you are someone who has struggled to even recognise boundaries in the past, let alone follow through with them, then your best shot would be to implement them slowly by following these few steps that therapist steph anya laid out: 1. setting measurable boundaries: you can inform him or her that you do not feel comfortable talking about other people. if they continue to bring up what \\u2018the streets are saying\\u2019 then you can either change the topic abruptly. \\u2018how is your mom doing?\\u2019, \\u2018i saw you went out last night; where did you guys go?\\u2019, can be a fun way to pull someone\\u2019s attention and momentarily make them forget what they were talking about, then you can bring up something new to talk about. next time, they will think twice before bringing up that person because you didn\\u2019t seem interested in it last time. 2. make them realistic: it is not easy for you to suddenly change habits, nor is it easy to adapt new ones. that goes for the other person. so if you find that they are still overstepping your boundaries, then you can stop engaging with them altogether. this can look like saying that you do not feel comfortable talking about other people, and if they don\\u2019t take you seriously, then you can stop responding to their calls or text messages until they understand that such topics are off limits now. 3. make sure they match the act. for example, if you have someone who always calls you at the end of the month, telling you all about their problems and asking you for money, then you can inform them that you can no longer help out financially. it doesn\\u2019t mean you will stop talking to them or help them with something else. just giving them money is now off the table. otherwise, if you have a friend that never does their work and always comes to you for help, then you can let them know that you will only check their final work. that means that they have to complete it and then come to you so that you can look it over. the good thing about boundaries is that they differ from person to person. whilst you would never think of emptying your piggy bank to help out a friend buy diapers for the fifth week in a row you would withdraw your last cents to give to a friend to put a downpayment on their car. that\\u2019s because both relationships are different. one person consistently uses you for money; the other has never once broken your trust. psychologist and author dr. ramani durvasula says that a constant disrespect of boundaries can lead to burnout. thus, durvasula encourages one to categorize people based on the history you have with them so that you are more mindful about the kinds of boundaries that each requires. durvasula adds that you should not be quick to cut off or walk out on someone who has a bad habit of letting you down, but that you can just shut that door. for example, if you have a friend who constantly flakes two hours before a date, you can stop making plans and instead video call. that way, you still maintain the relationship you have with them. you just don\\u2019t include them in your schedule and set aside time for them only to be left hanging. and if they insist on meeting up, then you tell them to come over to your place if they want to see you from now on. the key takeaway here is that boundaries have to be things that you yourself are not guilty of. if you have a tendency to raise your voice at people, ask for money all the time, and cancel plans at the last minute, then you need to work on yourself first. i love therapist kati morton\\u2019s hug and roll way of setting boundaries. it starts with a hug or showering them with love. for example, if you want to tell your mom that you would like to spend the holidays with your friend or boyfriend\\u2019s family, then you can start by saying \\u201chey mom, i like how you always arrange for the family to spend holidays together. they are always fun, and i love getting to see all my cousins.\\u201d then you roll with your alternative. \\u201cbut this holiday, i would like to stay with my friend\\u2019s family. they planned a trip to the coast, and i am really excited about that.\\u201d morton says this is effective, but you can expect some pushback because, again, you cannot control how the other person will react. now, using the hug and roll method, see how you could enforce these for other people towards you: the boundaries you set for yourself can look like: boundaries are important in order to protect and make relationships last. they come with an overbearing feeling of guilt, especially if you are new to it, such as feeling guilty about not helping someone when you always used to. and in some cases, boundaries lead to conflict and the heartache of having to walk away from someone because they continue to disrespect you. but you have to remember that the bigger goal here is to put yourself first. and historically speaking, that has been frowned upon and deemed selfish, but if you don\\u2019t put yourself first, who will? my name's uendjii and

\\u2b50\\n\\nif you want to boost your well being in 2025, skip the new year\\u2019s resolutions and set some boundaries instead. that means being clear about your wants, needs, and deal breakers and in the process, improving every aspect of your life. there are a few types of boundaries, says juliane taylor shore, a therapist in austin and author of setting boundaries that stick. physical boundaries, for example, protect your personal space; you might enforce one by taking a step back when someone gets too close. you can also set external boundaries, which means defining for yourself what is and isn\\u2019t ok, and acting accordingly. that makes boundaries different from a request. \\u201cif, for example, i had a family member with different political views, and i asked them to stop bringing [a certain candidate] up, that's a direct request,\\u201d she says. \\u201cwhereas a boundary is, \\u2018i\\u2019m not comfortable with this conversation continuing. i'm no longer going to speak to you about this.\\u2019\\u201d boundaries aren\\u2019t about controlling other people, she adds they\\u2019re about taking action to protect your mental health. think of boundaries as \\u201cyour own personal rules of engagement for how others will interact with you,\\u201d says terri cole, a new york based therapist and author of boundary boss. if you don\\u2019t set any, you\\u2019ll likely become stressed and burned out, and as resentment simmers, your relationships might become strained. with boundaries in place, on the other hand, your confidence and self esteem will leap upwards, you\\u2019ll have a greater sense of control, and you\\u2019ll feel both physically and emotionally safe. we asked therapists to share the boundaries they're setting for themselves in 2025. the lines they're drawing just might benefit you, too. shore has a problem: she works too much. she loves what she does, but she also wants to spend more time with her young daughter. sound familiar? follow her lead and set a boundary by deliberately pausing before agreeing to anything that will add extra work to your plate. when a request pings in shore\\u2019s inbox, for example, she\\u2019s carefully thinks through what she would inherently be saying no to by agreeing to take on the project. \\u201cthe truth is, i shouldn\\u2019t say yes to all the new things, because then i have no time,\\u201d she says. building in a buffer before auto accepting can help you overcome people pleasing tendencies and start to restore much needed balance in your life. \\u201cmy hope is that i\\u2019m a little more rested and a little more balanced in work life,\\u201d she says. \\u201ci\\u2019m already telling my daughter that mom is changing some stuff, and i need to really commit to that so she sees i\\u2019m serious.\\u201d wouldn\\u2019t it be nice to carve out some time that\\u2019s for you, and only you? that inspired cole\\u2019s new boundary: she\\u2019s not going to do anything that involves the internet before 11 a.m. (lucky for cole, she sets her own work hours.) instead, she\\u2019ll jump on her trampoline, walk her dog, have coffee with her husband, feed her chickens, and meditate. \\u201cit\\u2019s ok to do it. the realization is that nothing falls apart,\\u201d she says. \\u201cwe think it'll be a calamity, but then things keep ticking.\\u201d read more: 6 ways to set boundaries at work even when it\\u2019s uncomfortable if staying offline until 11 isn\\u2019t feasible for you, pick a different time, she suggests. maybe you could adopt an internet free hour in the evening, swear off technology one day each weekend, or stop responding to texts after 8 p.m. if you think of boundaries the way cole does as self care and self consideration you\\u2019ll likely realize that reserving time for yourself replenishes you. \\u201cyou\\u2019ll go into the day with such good energy, instead of having resentful or constricted energy,\\u201d she says. \\u201cyou\\u2019ll be happier, the work you\\u2019re doing will be better, and the way you\\u2019re interacting in your intimate relationships will be better.\\u201d alex oliver gans is ready to stop doomscrolling and you would probably benefit from doing the same. the san francisco based therapist recognizes that constantly refreshing the headlines takes a toll on him; during the workday, it makes him less emotionally available to clients, and it causes unnecessary stress. \\u201cthere\\u2019s a lot of pressure to keep up, like it's what's expected of me or the right thing to do, and i need to redefine what the actual limit is for me,\\u201d he says. \\u201cwhat i would love to do is approach it like i imagine it was back in the day before cable news, when the newspaper arrived once or twice a day.\\u201d if you don\\u2019t like your compulsive news seeking habit either, join him in checking the headlines just twice a day. if that still feels like too much, oliver gans suggests subscribing to a weekly newsletter that summarizes recent events, and catching up in one condensed session. you\\u2019ll probably end up feeling more focused and optimistic, he predicts. in 2025, enter a long distance relationship with your phone at least overnight. oliver gans is going to start keeping his other half (aka his phone) in another room, and he encourages others to set the same boundary. \\u201cnobody has told me i need to have my phone next to me all the time, but for a long time, it was like, what if somebody calls in the middle of the night, or there's an emergency?\\u201d he says. \\u201cbut i also can't think of a time when that happened.\\u201d if you, too, operate under the assumption that other people expect you to be available 24/7, reevaluate that notion, he suggests. you might find that if you keep your phone in another room overnight after letting your friends know about your new boundary you\\u2019ll sleep better and feel more refreshed in the morning. heather stevenson, a clinical psychologist in new york city, puts a lot of work into ensuring her relationships thrive making sure conversations don\\u2019t falter, for example, and helping other people open up. that\\u2019s often at the expense of sharing much about herself. \\u201cit comes at a cost to me, and ends up really draining me,\\u201d she says. \\u201ci want relationships to be reciprocal and mutual.\\u201d read more: how to set boundaries with relatives, according to family therapists perhaps you recognize the same patterns in your own relationships. in 2025, take a step back in conversations, especially with friends, family members, and in romantic relationships, and let the other person put in some effort. \\u201cmaybe it\\u2019s not filling in all the gaps when there\\u2019s a lull, or saying no to spending time with someone where there's that imbalance,\\u201d stevenson says. if you follow in her footsteps, you\\u2019ll likely find that you\\u2019re happier with the clarity you need to prioritize the most fulfilling relationships. kathleen smith\\u2019s days often pass in a virtual haze. the washington, d.c. based therapist sees clients online during the day, and then hops back on zoom in the evening to meet with fellow leaders in the organizations she\\u2019s involved with. then there\\u2019s even more tech when it\\u2019s time to catch up with long distance friends and family. \\u201ci\\u2019ve had to think about how much of my life i want to spend in that medium,\\u201d says smith, author of true to you. \\u201ci\\u2019m trying to be very thoughtful about how much of my week is on zoom.\\u201d if that resonates with you, make it a point to say no to extracurricular opportunities that involve online meetings, or let the organizers know that you can\\u2019t commit to lots of virtual time. then, they can choose to proceed with or without you, smith says: \\u201cpeople get to decide, do they still want you to be part of what they're doing if you're not going to be on zoom with them a lot of time?\\u201d she also recommends seeking out community based opportunities that prioritize getting together in person. \\u201call those side conversations that happen when you get together with people are really good for your mental health\\u201d and will help brighten your year. women, in particular, tend to have a conditioned aversion to causing any sort of perceived discomfort or inconvenience. that's why so many are always apologizing, points out lauren farina, a psychotherapist in chicago. \\u201ci think that sets the tone to really disempower ourselves,\\u201d she says. \\u201cwe put ourselves in a subordinate position when we're apologizing for something that isn't even our fault or our responsibility.\\u201d in 2025, she\\u2019s setting a boundary by only apologizing when she truly means it. if you recognize that you could benefit from doing the same, she recommends training yourself to pause before reacting which can help you be intentional about what you say. another of her favorite strategies: if you\\u2019re tempted to apologize, challenge yourself to express gratitude instead. \\u201cinstead of saying, \\u2018i\\u2019m so sorry to bother you,\\u2019 you might say, \\u2018thanks so much for taking the time,\\u2019\\u201d she suggests. in 2025, one of farina\\u2019s boundaries will be no longer saying \\u201cyes\\u201d when she really means \\u201cno,\\u201d like accepting a social invitation out of obligation. \\u201cmy values include connection and authenticity, so saying yes out of a sense of duty is antithetical to those values,\\u201d she says. \\u201ci\\u2019m really committing and i encourage others to commit to being thoughtful and intentional about what they take on.\\u201d read more: is intermittent fasting good or bad for you? to implement this boundary, farina suggests getting into the habit of asking yourself this question: \\u201cdid i say what i meant? and how is that affecting my mind and body?\\u201d by getting in tune with yourself and your desires, you\\u2019ll get better at only saying yes when you really mean it, she says. that will boost your quality of life. \\u201cwe all have a finite pool of internal resources,\\u201d she says. \\u201ci'm hoping that by setting this boundary, it\\u2019ll free up my time and energy.\\u201d sarah rafik botrus isn\\u2019t going to have bad blood with the vampires in her life the ones who feed off and drain other people\\u2019s energy. but she is going to protect herself from them. botrus, a therapist in pasadena, calif., has taken inventory of the people who leave her feeling emotionally, mentally, or even physically exhausted. \\u201cthey\\u2019re constantly negative, overwhelmingly needy, create unnecessary drama, emotionally dump on you, and have a hard time reciprocating in relationships,\\u201d she says. maybe you have some energy vampires in your life, too. botrus recommends reflecting on how much time you can handle being around them: two hours? ten minutes? then, set a boundary by only spending that amount of time in their presence. you might tell them: \\u201ci only have 5 minutes to talk, and then i have to head out to an appointment.\\u201d or: \\u201ci\\u2019ll stop by for an hour, but then i have to leave to get to another obligation.\\u201d with time, she predicts, draining relationships will become more positive, because you\\u2019re not allowing them to suck up too much of your time and energy. botrus is setting a boundary around social media in 2025 by limiting how much she shares about her personal life. \\u201ci think it\\u2019s important to decide what\\u2019s sacred and doesn\\u2019t need an audience,\\u201d she says. when she\\u2019s looking at her life through a camera, she\\u2019s found, it tarnishes her ability to fully experience and enjoy the moment. plus, feeding your special, private moments into the algorithm can taint them instead of belonging to you, they belong to the world, where they may attract all sorts of feedback. botrus is hoping to get pregnant in the coming year, and she plans to eventually share the news by sending a card to her loved ones, rather than plastering it across the internet. \\u201cthen it becomes about me and my husband, or my loved ones, rather than having these moments with the camera,\\u201d she says. if you\\u2019re ready to double tap that sentiment, ease in via a dry january esque social media detox, botrus advises. disable your accounts for the entire month, or if that feels like a step too far, commit to only posting two days of the week. cutting back on how much time you spend scrolling through your networks\\u2019 updates can override the need you might feel to keep up and, in doing so, help you feel like a more active participant in all the moments you\\u2019ll look back on fondly at the end of the year. contact us at

come to seek absolution, is more than a mere annoyance. in limiting our ethical considerations to tricky personal situations and dilemmas, it directs our thinking away from the larger structural injustices of our time. the term \\u201cfirst world problem\\u201d is used to describe the type of minor nuisance that occupies the minds of the bourgeoisie. you dropped an airpod in the urinal. you spilled chardonnay on the divan. whole foods was out of pomegranates. and so forth. these are perfectly real frustrations, but they only afflict the comfortable. we might define a parallel quandary in the field of moral philosophy: the first world ethical problem. these are dilemmas about right and wrong that don\\u2019t actually touch any of the major ethical crises of our time, or the issues of structural injustice. they\\u2019re problems that only arise, or seem worthy of spending time on, once you reach a certain level of wealth and privilege. the new york times advice column, the ethicist, is filled with these kinds of bourgeois dilemmas. the ethicist a role a few columnists have inhabited over the years purports to offer \\u201cadvice on life\\u2019s trickiest situations and moral dilemmas.\\u201d since 2015 the answers to the public\\u2019s queries have been written by philosophy professor kwame anthony appiah. as appiah explained in an interview shortly after taking the ethicist role, the questions that he answers are not those about, say, the placement of an olive fork or how to avoid being audited by the irs in other words, those that could be answered by other guides to bourgeois life, like emily post, a lawyer, or a financial planner. \\u201can ethical question is, roughly speaking, a question about how you ought to conduct yourself, what you owe to other people, how you ought to think about what you do, and how it impacts the world whether on other people or on animals or on the environment,\\u201d appiah says. he has also said that he seeks not just to answer a particular question but to show readers how to think about questions that arise in their lives. this all sounds unobjectionable. but an examination of some of the questions and answers from recent years reveals that bourgeois values and worldviews are (surprise!) inadequate for approaching the kinds of large scale problems we ought to be thinking about. ethicist questions fall into a number of common categories. here, we present a discussion of some of the most notable, and the underlying values they reveal. here we have questions concerned with minor violations of private property rights. in one typical case, an ethicist reader writes in to ask, \\u201care people who read magazines without paying \\u2018stealing\\u2019 their content?\\u201d at their local barnes and noble, it seems, this person has witnessed other customers who \\u201cgrab multiple magazines and take them to their table with their coffee\\u201d to read, only to later \\u201cput the magazines back in the racks without paying for them.\\u201d the questioner\\u2019s indignation is palpable, and they stridently complain that their fellow bookstore goers are \\u201c\\u2018stealing\\u2019 content that is meant to be purchased.\\u201d this person may be the perfect example of an ethicist reader. they\\u2019re peeved about a perceived transgression that doesn\\u2019t affect them in any way, or really harm anyone (the store gets its magazines back and loses nothing), and they want the entire world to know about it. underlying the mentality of the question is a core belief in the sanctity of property. the idea is that even immaterial things like reading an article must always be paid for in a market transaction, and that no circumstances can justify sacrilege against that holy principle. the correct response to this kind of question would be \\u201cwhat on earth are you talking about?\\u201d followed by \\u201cdon\\u2019t you have something better to do?\\u201d but because the ethicist and the new york times as a bourgeois institution fundamentally shares the belief that property is sacred, this is not the answer the complainer receives. instead, appiah tells them that reading the magazines is acceptable because barnes and noble itself hasn\\u2019t opted to \\u201ccrack down on the behavior,\\u201d and is \\u201cacting as if what they\\u2019re doing is ok.\\u201d in other words, the appropriate conduct for the situation is whatever the business owner decides. property law has resolved the ethical question. importantly, the creators of the magazines in question don\\u2019t enter into the calculus: there\\u2019s no consideration of whether it\\u2019s a small publication that could really use the sales or, say, the new yorker, which is doing fine and doesn\\u2019t need your money. the principle is simply that owning property allows you to dictate propriety.1 some property related questions in the column are merely frivolous. (\\u201cis it wrong if a friend sells my hand me downs?\\u201d) others, though, reveal serious shortcomings in the ethicist\\u2019s understanding of the world. one such question is \\u201cis shoplifting ok if the shop owner is awful?,\\u201d from february 2024. in this column, a reader asks about a friend of theirs who \\u201cshoplifts on a regular basis,\\u201d but only from \\u201ccompanies that are known to treat their employees badly, or that knowingly source their products from places where human rights are violated, or whose owners/c.e.o.s donate to ultraconservative, authoritarian leaning candidates.\\u201d in keeping with the property is sacred motif, the ethicist concludes that this is not acceptable, because it allegedly undermines the overall social system \\u201cthat allows people to hold on to their possessions and dispose of them only when they choose to.\\u201d the response muddies the waters, because (despite what mitt romney might tell you) corporations are not people, and the personal property of individuals is very different from corporate property on a mass scale. stealing from your neighbor and stealing from walmart are entirely different acts, because \\u201cwalmart\\u201d as a corporate entity can\\u2019t suffer feelings of betrayal, violation, and loss the way a human being would. this crucial difference goes undiscussed. what\\u2019s more, the ethicist\\u2019s sense of moral priorities is completely backwards. the column treats a single individual\\u2019s violation of the property rights of a company as distasteful and dangerous, while regarding the fact that the companies in question damage many people\\u2019s fundamental human rights (remember that they \\u201ctreat their employees badly\\u201d and \\u201cknowingly\\u201d have abuses in their supply chains) as unremarkable. appiah even says that the companies\\u2019 bosses are \\u201cexercising their rights as citizens\\u201d by supporting \\u201cultraconservative, authoritarian\\u201d politicians. (in other words, they have a right to curtail others\\u2019 rights, as long as they do it through the established political channels!) there\\u2019s a distinct class bias to the direction the ethical condemnation is pointed, and the direction it\\u2019s not pointed. there\\u2019s plenty of concern that acts of petty theft could damage the fabric of society, but no acknowledgement that the businesses in question damage it far more, simply by continuing to operate. there is, of course, a valid criticism of the act of stealing from a company like (for example) the notoriously misogynistic and transphobic hobby lobby or the brutally anti labor amazon. namely, it doesn\\u2019t damage them enough. they\\u2019re not really going to notice a missing apple or pack of batteries, and things like unionizing their workforce would be more effective in challenging the companies to shape up. but at worst it\\u2019s a fairly anodyne act, neither praiseworthy nor unspeakably villainous. to loudly denounce such thefts in the pages of the new york times presupposes that the current order of property, power, and ownership is legitimate and must be protected. by the same logic, a 19th century version of the ethicist could have justified turning jean valjean in for stealing that loaf of bread in les mis\\u00e9rables. speaking of turning people in, this brings us to another common trope of ethicist questions, which is\\u2026 in the 2015 interview, appiah admitted that many ethicist questions revolve around determining what people can say to whom. in many of these questions, the writer asks whether it\\u2019s okay to turn someone in to the authorities, condemn them, or just reveal privileged information. often, readers are looking for permission to reveal information in the form of snitching on another person (which makes sense given how gossipy the times\\u2019 headlines and overall tone are). ethicist questioners also often want to know whether they should intrude into someone else\\u2019s life, to stop \\u201cminding their own business.\\u201d notable examples include: two especially concerning queries involve snitching to two of the most racist and violent authority groups in the country: the police and immigration and customs enforcement. in \\u201cwas i right to call the cops on a black man breaking into a car?,\\u201d appiah, first and foremost, affirms the sanctity of private property and the proper role of police in protecting that property. it\\u2019s your \\u201ccivic responsibility,\\u201d he tells the writer, to report an act of apparent (and unsuccessful!) burglary. the worst part, though, is the reasoning he uses to assuage the writer\\u2019s concern that calling the police on a black man may very well lead to the man or others mistaken for him being \\u201charassed\\u201d or killed. (the column describes this as \\u201cthe tragic way things too often end between police and people of color,\\u201d which is something of an understatement.) to justify calling the cops, appiah suggests something that is purely speculative: that the man in question could steal a firearm from a car and then, presumably, use it on another person. he writes, \\u201cin recent years, the theft of firearms, often from vehicles, has risen sharply where you live. your state also has the highest rate of black homicide victims in the country (and most violent crimes are indeed intraracial). so yes, i\\u2019d say you did the right thing.\\u201d this response is stunning in its callousness and presumption. appiah\\u2019s use of the word \\u201cintraracial\\u201d here is also notable. you can bet the reader isn\\u2019t going to be thinking about, say, \\u201cwhite on white\\u201d crime, so in this context it obviously refers to \\u201cblack on black crime,\\u201d which is a racist and debunked trope used sometimes in response to concern about police violence against black people. when people such as political commentators talk about black on black crime, it suggests that there\\u2019s something uniquely violent about black people and that this violence is actually the thing people should be concerned about as opposed to police violence against black people. having squashed the writer\\u2019s concerns about calling the cops, appiah then goes on to talk about how the police need to \\u201croot out\\u201d more of their own bad apples another liberal talking point that mischaracterizes the problem with police (the problem is systemic, not one of a few individuals). now let\\u2019s go back to the writer\\u2019s scenario. it turns out that the man \\u201cbreaking into a car\\u201d had opened an unlocked car door and went no further, having been deterred by the writer shouting at him, and so no one\\u2019s car was actually stolen! overall, there doesn\\u2019t really seem to be a good reason for involving the police here unless one wishes to act as a private arm of the police and make sure no small \\u201ccrime\\u201d including attempted burglary goes unpunished. the potential fallout of calling the police seems disproportionate to what the man in question actually did. appiah focuses more on what the man might do as opposed to what he did, which makes it seem like he\\u2019s really stretching for a reason to justify a deference to authority. (if we are serious about considering hypotheticals, though, we might consider the abuse that the man might undergo assuming he survives his encounter with the cops in a jail or prison for opening somebody\\u2019s car door.) in another entry, a questioner asked whether they should report an acquaintance to immigration and customs enforcement (ice) after finding out they only got married in order to secure someone citizenship. the ethicist said it would be a good idea to report the married couple to the government, assuming they were certain about the facts, and even recommended they seek out an online form for the purpose. now, a person who has \\u201cfaked\\u201d a marriage for citizenship might not be as stigmatized or in danger as, say, an immigrant crossing the u.s. mexico border without documents, but reporting the person and setting in motion a process which could lead to their deportation is to subject the person to trauma, hardship, and possibly violence (depending on the circumstances they left behind in their home country and whether they feel comfortable going back). appiah also reminds the reader that millions of other immigrants have applied \\u201cproperly\\u201d and are \\u201cwaiting their turn.\\u201d he notes that he, too, is an immigrant, and presumably, he followed the rules to become a citizen, so everyone else can, and should, too. liberals and conservatives alike love this immigration talking point: just do it the right way \\u201clegally\\u201d and everything will be fine! of course, migrants at the border are doing something legal by seeking asylum. and generally, the path to u.s. citizenship is expensive and not as easy as people would assume. lastly, appiah\\u2019s assertion that the writer\\u2019s duty to report would be different were she not a u.s. citizen reaffirms the idea that people\\u2019s loyalty to an abstraction like the nation state is ultimately more important than thinking about what might happen to the person who gets reported to ice. the ethicist is calm and cool about matters here, and ice is just another important authority doing the work of keeping people where they\\u2019re supposed to be: on one side of a completely arbitrary border. deeper and more interesting questions as to whether we need borders (there is a good argument that we don\\u2019t) are not to be asked. in the ethicist\\u2019s world, it\\u2019s all law and order, all the time. \\u201cwhite guilt\\u201d is another ethicist commonplace. in this subgenre of column, a white reader writes in to the new york times because they\\u2019re terribly worried about some minor, ultimately symbolic issue where they could be perceived as racially insensitive. they want appiah to soothe their anxieties. often, the issue at hand involves some kind of object in the reader\\u2019s possession. one of the classic examples is \\u201ci\\u2019m white. should i repatriate my african art?,\\u201d from december 2023. in this letter, the questioner says they own a \\u201csignificant collection of masks, statues, figurines and other objects from mostly west african cultures,\\u201d and that they\\u2019re worried about the possibility these objects were acquired \\u201cvia an unfair transaction\\u201d during colonialism, asking appiah if it\\u2019s \\u201cpossible to repatriate them.\\u201d other typical letters in this vein ask questions like: sometimes an obsession with policing other people\\u2019s behavior comes into play, as in the case of the self described \\u201cwhite woman living in a mostly white town\\u201d who asks \\u201cshould i speak up about a worker\\u2019s confederate battle flag?\\u201d confronted with these earth shattering dilemmas, appiah gives a variety of answers: no, you don\\u2019t need to repatriate your african masks, because you have no idea whether they were purchased legitimately or not; yes, it\\u2019s probably a bad idea to give your racist ancestor a \\u201cplace of honor\\u201d on your mantelpiece; yes, you should tell your friend it makes you uncomfortable to see a figurine of \\u201csanta in black face\\u201d; and it doesn\\u2019t matter very much what you do with the nazi helmet, provided you\\u2019re not a neo nazi yourself. but it\\u2019s the questions themselves, and the decision to give them prominence in the pages of the times, that\\u2019s really interesting. the concept of racism and racial justice on display in these questions is very liberal, and very bourgeois. in essence, the kind of person who writes in to the ethicist thinks of racism as a question of individual manners, rather than one of sociopolitical power. to them, racism is when a particular person says something, or owns something, that might cause others offense; it\\u2019s not, for instance, when the entire police force pulls black drivers over more frequently than white ones, or when the standard of medical care or housing available to people of certain ethnicities is worse than others. conversely, combating racism becomes a matter of making one\\u2019s individual behavior nice and polite (or in the worker with confederate flag incident, reprimanding others whose behavior is not). as long as no one says the wrong thing, and no one displays the wrong symbolic object, there\\u2019s no racism; all is well in liberalville. the idea that dealing with racism might require a mass political movement to uproot and overturn racist systems of power is completely outside the moral universe of the ethicist. appiah might give a mini lecture on the nuances of virtue signaling or tell a reader to \\u201c[take] in the ugliness\\u201d of a confederate historical site, but he\\u2019ll never tell a reader to organize a protest at the nearest police precinct or homeowner\\u2019s association, where it might actually do some good. in 1938, the great bolshevik revolutionary and political theorist leon trotsky wrote a short book called their morals and ours, in which he laid out his views on the whole vexed subject of ethics and how they mix with politics. in one memorable passage, trotsky blasts the self righteous armchair moralists of his own time: what a perfect description of the ethicist and its readers! today, there are indeed \\u201cgreat historical movements\\u201d to be involved in, from the struggle to defund the police and abolish mass incarceration to the cause of the palestinian people. but to look at the pages of the new york times advice column, you\\u2019d never know it. \\u201csmug narrowness\\u201d and \\u201cpolitical cowardice\\u201d are the order of the day, as appiah and his fans fret endlessly about the appropriate way to dispose of their trinkets and tokens something no actual advocate for racial justice, or any other kind, ever asked them to do. beyond their little bubble of privilege, history marches on. some ethicist letters are even more clearly about \\u201crich people problems.\\u201d these involve large sums of money, exclusive institutions, and other trappings of the financial elite, such as: half the time, the readers of the ethicist seem to live in the decadent and absurd world of a p.g. wodehouse novel, or perhaps a particularly crap episode of downton abbey. other times, they write to appiah about the problems they\\u2019re having with members of the lower classes. for instance, one reader asks, \\u201ca homeless man sleeps in the lobby of my apartment building. what should i do?\\u201d the reader, who lives in a \\u201clovely old apartment in a relatively upper class suburb of a major u.s. city,\\u201d is troubled that \\u201ca homeless man has been sleeping in the unlocked vestibule of my building,\\u201d even though he \\u201chasn\\u2019t directly harmed any person in the building\\u201d or done anything especially offensive beyond perhaps once eating someone\\u2019s delivered food order. the ethicist tells the reader that \\u201cyour safety matters,\\u201d implying that the homeless are inherently dangerous, and suggests talking to others although not, notably, talking to the homeless man himself or directly offering him help of any kind. the ethicist also suggests \\u201cputting a lock on the vestibule.\\u201d (there\\u2019s the fixation on protecting property again.) while appiah does barely admit that the problem of homelessness is a societal one, his final words on the matter are utterly disappointing: \\u201ci\\u2019m glad that you\\u2019re treating him as a human being in need. but your safety matters, too. helping to ameliorate his situation isn\\u2019t a responsibility that should fall on you alone. it falls on us, collectively, and we\\u2019ve let you down.\\u201d really? in a time when homelessness and the demonization of the homeless has reached record levels, \\u201cwe\\u2019ve let you down\\u201d is the best he\\u2019s got? for that matter, is it really the comfortably homed letter writer who\\u2019s been \\u201clet down,\\u201d and whose \\u201csafety\\u201d needs to be considered? the implication is that the reader\\u2019s discomfort at having to encounter this man is a more significant problem than his actual lack of a home. in this way, perhaps appiah is like his fellow times columnist pamela paul, who, as hamilton nolan recently assessed in a deliciously funny blog post, is simply unable to \\u201caccess true anger at the state of the world\\u201d due to having spent \\u201cdecades ensconced in bourgeois antechambers.\\u201d additional queries in the \\u201crich people problems\\u201d category include: here, the questions only become relevant if you\\u2019re wealthy enough to have domestic help in the first place. since the vast majority of people aren\\u2019t, it\\u2019s unclear why they\\u2019re being published and notably, there\\u2019s rarely a question from a working person asking \\u201cwhat should i do about my boss?\\u201d in fact, this genre is so predictable that we\\u2019ve devised a mix n match table for you to auto generate your own ethicist questions: let\\u2019s return, for a moment, to our old pal leon trotsky. in their morals and ours, he draws a clear distinction between morality in general and \\u201cbourgeois\\u201d morality. as he describes it, the latter not only has its origins in class inequality, but serves as a mechanism to protect that inequality: morality is one of the ideological functions in [class] struggle. the ruling class forces its ends upon society and habituates it to considering all those means which contradict its ends as immoral. that is the chief function of official morality. it pursues the idea of the \\u201cgreatest possible happiness\\u201d not for the majority but for a small and ever diminishing minority. such a regime could not have endured for even a week through force alone. it needs the cement of morality. the production of this cement constitutes the profession of the petty bourgeois theoreticians and moralists. they radiate all the colors of the rainbow but in the final analysis remain apostles of slavery and submission. once again, we can see exactly this dynamic at work in the pages of the ethicist. there is a \\u201csmall and ever diminishing minority\\u201d for whom the advice is intended, and whose worldview is reflected in the columns. the \\u201cmajority\\u201d appear as a never ending source of trouble for that minority, not as subjects in their own right. at every turn, the bedrock assumption is that the actions of poor and working class people are likely to cause a problem, one that appiah and his sage advice will help to overcome. the idea that the reader might be working class themself never arises. in this moral universe, working people\\u2019s behavior needs to be monitored and policed. gambling nannies need to be fired (if only because they might one day be tempted to steal!), and homeless men need to get out of the lobby so polite new york times readers don\\u2019t have to feel uncomfortable. the fundamental message is that people should know their place, and the behavior appropriate to it. with such \\u201ccement\\u201d is the elite liberal order, the class order, maintained. on occasion, a newly minted member of the professional managerial class someone from working class roots stands at the precipice of entry into elite life and questions which way to go. should they work for an evil corporation and have the lifestyle and financial stability that that kind of salary affords, or choose the less remunerative path of employment in a public agency or nonprofit so they can serve the common good? this is precisely the situation in the classic ethicist column \\u201cis it ok to take a law firm job defending climate villains?\\u201d here, the writer is about to graduate from law school and is entertaining a job offer from a firm that they know will require them to represent \\u201cmany polluters and companies that i feel are making the apocalyptic climate situation even worse.\\u201d this entry is particularly notable for the astronomical amount of bullshit and \\u201cboth sides ism\\u201d that appiah flings at the writer. appiah starts off by writing, it\\u2019s hard to see how the world would be improved if such corporations couldn\\u2019t find legal advice and representation. is a corporation really going to behave better if it doesn\\u2019t know what the law is? at which point we must emphasize that this is a total misrepresentation of what corporate lawyers do. they don\\u2019t simply \\u201ctell corporations what the law is,\\u201d which sounds harmless. they help prove in a court of law that the corporation\\u2019s evil acts are in compliance with the law! also, it\\u2019s actually not hard to see how \\u201cthe world would be improved\\u201d if climate destroying companies couldn\\u2019t find legal representation! a corporation that is actively destroying the environment and the future of the human species shouldn\\u2019t be allowed to exist, let alone have representation! appiah continues, \\u201cas with criminal defense, we need lawyers who will work diligently for people and associations whether they approve of them or not.\\u201d but this isn\\u2019t true. as with the shoplifting case, it assumes that the same calculus applies to both \\u201cpeople\\u201d and \\u201cassociations\\u201d (in this case, climate destroying corporations). but while we do need lawyers who \\u201cwill work diligently\\u201d for people they don\\u2019t approve of in criminal cases, why do we need lawyers who will work diligently to defend corporate wrongdoers? why are chocolate companies entitled to have someone diligently argue in defense of child slavery, for instance? appiah suggests being a corporate lawyer is actually an act of public service on par with\\u2026 a job in public service. never mind that the lure of corporate law sucks eager law school graduates away from other \\u201cpublic interest\\u201d jobs all the time in what has been called the \\u201cconveyer belt to corporate law.\\u201d instead of focusing on the people the writer could be helping other than corporations, appiah focuses on making the choice to work for a malevolent corporate client look good. he even uses the logic of the effective altruists, who argue that taking a high paying corporate job and then donating the money to a good cause would actually be a way to do the most good. (this is doubtful.) he tells the writer that they might be able to change a firm from the inside. (again, doubtful.) and he reassures the writer that they won\\u2019t abandon their values just by working for a corporation, even one that is actively wrecking the planet. somehow times ethical theory has brought us to the conclusion that the right thing to do is to help destroy the world. what is one bourgeois institution where propriety reigns supreme? the family. enter some of the most important, common, and thorny ethicist queries. frequently, the questioner is trying to deal with a particularly challenging family member: someone with age related issues or care needs, mental illness, a drug problem, neurodiversity, or someone formerly or currently incarcerated. many of the questioners in these family scenarios are deeply unsympathetic people who tend to point out that while everyone else in their family is healthy, productive, and thriving, there\\u2019s one person who is making things difficult: these situations are particularly concerning because the children in these scenarios are dealing with issues that our culture tends not to have a lot of empathy for: drug use or addiction, repeated imprisonment, homelessness or the threat of homelessness, and special needs issues. the incarcerated son in the first example above is also noted to be adopted, and you can sense that the writer sees the non genetic relationship to her son as a factor that might limit her responsibility to him. other family related ethical dilemmas include: whether to withhold money owed to the morally repugnant widow of a dearly beloved sibling, whether to cut off a daughter with learning disabilities and autism, whether to support an elderly mother who refuses to manage her money well, whether to help a hoarding parent, whether to shun a politically toxic ex brother in law. some families have plainly bizarre internal dynamics, such as the spouse complaining that their husband always flies first class while putting the rest of the family in coach. (here, appiah refers to the \\u201cinstitution of marriage\\u201d and how it should be about couples treating each other as equals. he mentions the husband\\u2019s presumed enjoyment of \\u201cwarmed cashews and lie flat seat\\u201d seriously, only people who have actually flown first class know about the warmed nuts as a situation which requires more \\u201cequity\\u201d to remedy. what\\u2019s his suggestion? \\u201ctaking turns\\u201d in first class. but this is deeply unsatisfying! why can\\u2019t they both fly first class surely a man who \\u201cloves to travel\\u201d with his family could afford it. and what about how selfish it is for anyone to treat their companion this way, regardless of whether the two people are bound by \\u201cthe institution of marriage\\u201d? one wonders whether appiah\\u2019s answer would have been different had the woman in question been, say, the man\\u2019s assistant or someone else he didn\\u2019t consider his class or social \\u201cequal.\\u201d) readers often want a way to control how their money is spent or to demand that their family members be responsible with finances. (\\u201ci\\u2019m supporting my adult son. he just gave $1,000 to a homeless woman.\\u201d) in the case of the daughter with autism, the parent wants to support her if she\\u2019s in college. support is often highly conditional on a person meeting some arbitrary worthiness criteria, meaning the person writing in often wants to impose a \\u201cmoral test\\u201d on the recipient of their largesse. in ethicist responses of this type, love, care, and support for others are all based on very carefully constructed notions of what is proper. personal boundaries are noted to be important, good behavior and \\u201cmental competence\\u201d dictate mutual care toward family members, people should not be too much of a burden to each other, children may be cut off once they reach legal adulthood, and sensible money management is very, very important. perhaps the most useful function of the ethicist in this section is to help a wealthy reader to sleep better at night when the ethicist tells them that their reasoning is \\u201csound\\u201d when they choose to cut off their \\u201caddicted\\u201d son from all funds except those used for drug treatment or that they are right to demand their child with mental illness stay on their medication in order to keep their housing. but ultimately, the problems that the writers face in these family scenarios often occur because in the u.s., the family is a substitute for the existence of a real social safety net. there would be no ethical dilemma about whether to care for a difficult relative in a society where everyone was already guaranteed housing, food, and healthcare, and we didn\\u2019t cage people to try to reduce crime or punish them for drug use. often, it\\u2019s strange that the new york times questioners are even in a position to make certain decisions. for instance, the son in prison is in need of money to pay for a lawyer and court fines. if everyone was given quality legal representation regardless of their ability to pay, and if we didn\\u2019t have an extortionate system of fines and fees that bleed the already impoverished, these wouldn\\u2019t be issues, and a judgmental wealthier parent wouldn\\u2019t have to enter the picture. a more just society would not tie perceived worthiness to basic survival. and it would not limit us to receiving acceptance, support, or love from those people we share a close genetic relationship with. the unasked and more important question here has to be what all of us owe people struggling with any unmet need and how we could create a society to meet everyone\\u2019s basic needs regardless of whether we personally like or love them. in short, could we conceive of a society in which we are responsible for everyone, not just our own family members? this question cannot be entertained by the bourgeoisie, for whom the family helps maintain the political and economic order (think inheritance), as well as the strict gender and sexuality norms that come along with it. appiah\\u2019s responses are usually not as bad as the ethicist questions themselves. with questions like the ones from the infamous \\u201cam i the asshole?\\u201d reddit page, he usually points out to the writer that, yes, you are the asshole in this situation. but appiah has bourgeois values himself, hence his abhorrence at shoplifting, his concern about the risk posed by a random homeless man, and his suggestion that it\\u2019s virtuous to call ice on someone if you know they\\u2019ve broken the rules. appiah is from an aristocratic family. he\\u2019s the grandson of sir stafford cripps on his mother\\u2019s side and belongs to an elite ghanaian family on his father\\u2019s side. he has spent most of his comfortable life in the nation\\u2019s top private universities, and it shows in his lack of interest in deep issues of injustice. the absence of those deeper issues is the core problem with the ethicist. problems that have large structural causes (homelessness, drug use, etc.) are reduced to personal matters between individuals what does a writer owe this particular homeless man or person with a drug problem? questions of social ethics are excluded from consideration. for instance, some of the most critically important ethical questions of our time are: what do we owe the victims of the climate catastrophe, present and future?2 if your tax dollars are funding crimes against humanity, are you obliged to march in the streets? how can we introduce a healthcare system that ensures people aren\\u2019t dying preventable deaths? how can we end grotesque wealth inequality? the ethicist zeroes in on highly individualistic and essentially trivial dimensions of injustice what should i do with this racist artifact? a better and more important question is: what kind of duty does each of us have to bring about an end to the many racial inequalities that still persist? in the pages of the ethicist, we have obligations vis a vis coworkers, neighbors, family members, the people in our immediate vicinity, but \\u201cethics\\u201d extends no further. solidarity is not an ethical imperative. we also have ethical quandaries only when unique situations arise; the status quo does not raise ethical issues. this is the same deficiency that plagues the famous \\u201ctrolley problem,\\u201d which plunges people into a situation in medias res where all of the choices are horrible. because the question is constructed in a very specific way, a discussion of the factors that produced the range of choices now under consideration is precluded. leftists have long criticized \\u201cbourgeois morality\\u201d for precisely this reason. it considers moral questions within a particular economic structure but doesn\\u2019t consider questions about that economic structure. the result is that the most trivial matters are blown up into having outsized significance, while the most significant matters are simply excluded from view. the questions are not much different from the type of questions made famous on curb your enthusiasm: who gets the last perrier? is there an implicit limit on the number of hors d\\u2019oeuvres each dinner party guest is allowed to take? is it rude to toss your keys to a valet? can you use golfing advice that you get from overhearing someone else\\u2019s lesson? curb wrung humor from the fact that the stakes are so obviously trivial, and it can be richly entertaining to watch people with different answers to these questions argue about them passionately. but curb your enthusiasm dilemmas are not, needless to say, the world\\u2019s serious ethical questions. the new york times ethicist, too, could be waved away as just a bit of fun. why spoil it by taking it too seriously? but the world that produces these questions, and these answers, is deeply broken. we need to talk about all of the major ethical quandaries that don\\u2019t get an airing in the paper of record because it gives over page space to discussions of whether to fire your nanny because they have a gambling problem. this is a common theme among american liberals of the kind who are likely to read the new york times. it can also be found in the ubiquitous \\u201cin this house, we believe\\u201d yard signs, which express the same basic view of property as a conservative parent thundering \\u201cnot under my roof!\\u201d at some perceived sin. how do you know everyone in the house believes the same stuff? do they get to stay in the house if they don\\u2019t? \\u21a9 in one entry, a writer asks, \\u201ci live in california. what do i owe climate denying kentuckians?\\u201d the entire premise that the state people live in determines how we should conceive of them as human beings impacted by climate change is, of course, rotten, and appiah is right to call the writer out on this. appiah writes, \\u201cwhat you have in mind looks like collective punishment,\\u201d in response to the writer asking whether people in a red state are owed help after a natural disaster given that they voted for leaders who helped make those disasters happen. but even then, appiah focuses on our duty towards americans when we really need to be thinking internationally about climate change and about what we owe the global south, whose people are burdened the most by climate change. it\\u2019s easy to say we ought to support \\u201cother americans.\\u201d but it requires a confrontation with power dynamics which is to say, colonialism and capitalism to truly confront the inequality embedded in the climate crisis and to propose a solution going forward. \\u21a9 our final issue of 2024 contains sparkling essays and incredible art. we ask: why is suburban sprawl everywhere and can it be stopped?

how does the professional environment change if a friendship ends abruptly and unpleasantly? anastasia sviridenko, it could be a garden and gardeners, paper, pencil, 2023 adel kim (b.1987) is a curator, manager, and researcher. she received an ma in art studies from hongik university (2018) and ma in cultural management from manchester university and moscow school of social and economic studies (2020). currently, she is a researcher in the reside / sustain: finnish & russian experiences / initiatives / practices project. i cherish friendships and love my friends; i tend to rely on them. we work and apply for grants together, and i consider them my safe space and comfort zone. my identity is defined through communication with them. at the same time, i cannot help but wonder how the word \\u201cfriendship\\u201d in art related topics has recently become so ubiquitous, generally gaining an unconditionally positive connotation in the same manner as \\u201ccare,\\u201d \\u201chospitality,\\u201d \\u201ccommunity,\\u201d you name it. romantic love has been investigated and deromanticized quite successfully; surprisingly, the friendship zone remains relatively uncontroversial. since i like putting things under a microscope, assuming that their \\u201cgoodness\\u201d is caused by a lack of analysis, in this text, i want to take a critical approach to scratch where it itches. this urge has grown from personal experience and the uncomfortable questions that followed. when asked about their choice to work with a particular artist, why would a curator answer \\u201cbecause we are friends\\u201d without hesitation? why is it not problematic for a networking workshop to mix friendships and professional connections, emphasising the benefits of helping friends since they will eventually feel obliged to help in return? how did such a neoliberal manipulative trick that openly instrumentalizes intimacy become acceptable? and on the other hand, why does nepotism evoke shitstorms in show business but pass smoothly in the arts? is \\u201cfriendly, warm hearted\\u201d corruption and favouritism legitimised? am i abusing my position of power by preferring to work with friends? and how does the professional environment change if a friendship ends abruptly and unpleasantly? when it comes to institutions or large scale, well funded, prestigious art shows, there normally exist standards for resolving conflicts of interest. mixing up the personal and the professional instigates discussions and criticism: the cases of adam szymczyk and christine macel, who included their partners\\u2019 works in documenta 14 and the main exhibition of the 57th venice biennial, respectively, although forgotten, remain unresolved. neither has ever reached a satisfying conclusion within the public discussion1. codes of conduct, proximity pledges, and basic ethical principles for art critics, curators, and dealers, prove that the art sector is worried that personal connections and preferences could affect artistic values (and prices). however, in a less institutionalised artistic environment, friendship is perceived as a priori positive. not only is it a legitimate reason for working together, but it is also a core element in constructing communities, networks, and self organized mutual support. it plays a crucial role for marginalised groups when official support structures are either inefficient or do not exist. it helps in the educational process, in learning criticality in relation to each other2. finally, friendship helps make human life longer, safer, and happier. this sounds quite reasonable: in a professional environment with such unequal points of entry, people of less privilege choose to support each other, resisting the unjust rules of the system. as s. nicole lane argued: \\u201cin the elite art world, nepotism matters. [\\u2026] for diy shows, giving friends a platform, fleshing out their cv, and supporting one another is the key to an idealistic and strong community [\\u2026]\\u201d3. i cannot agree more with her. but from what point onwards does the art world become the elite? and when does the support of close ones turn into the discrimination of others who are not from the same circle? the boundaries are blurred. as i observe it, the criteria must lie around notions of power, resources, and decision making, as well as profit and market. but honestly, don\\u2019t most of us, at some point, have these, to some extent? as o.k. fox and lucia love mention in one of the episodes of their podcast, art and labor, it\\u2019s possible for a representative of a marginalised group to receive a project grant and then use it to financially support their closest circle4. aren\\u2019t we applying double standards to similar human beings, assuming there are \\u201ctheir corrupted\\u201d and \\u201cour pure\\u201d types of friendship? making friends within the field the problem with nepotism (which, despite emerging from the latin for \\u201cnephew,\\u201d refers to any kind of personal ties causing advantages or privileges and includes friendship) is not new. frankly, it is hard not to work with friends. the specific nature of the art world, which partially makes work in the field so appealing, is this charming blend of \\u201cwork life\\u201d. often, one\\u2019s close circles are from the same professional community bubble. and when there are no clear boundaries, grey zones occur. the classical attitude towards friendship in the arts ignores these entanglements. in his text for frieze magazine, jan verwoert asked: \\u201chow do you draw the line between colleagues and friends? why even categorise?\\u201c. he was optimistic about such fusion: \\u201ccreating the structures that will support you spiritually and economically through building communities, alliances, friendships anything that is more than just a network\\u2019 is what the contract with your own generation is about.\\u201d 5 many, including curators as influential as francesco bonami, argue, that it doesn\\u2019t matter whether there is a conflict of interest or not, as long as it\\u2019s interesting, or good, art6. they seem to think of themselves as universal knowledge bearers \\u201cabove the fray\\u201d, not affected by any particular context, and directed only by the \\u201ctruth\\u201d. meanwhile, it\\u2019s proven that trusting connections is one of the key factors in the development of an artistic career. studies find that \\u201cartists with a large and diverse network of contacts were most likely to be famous, regardless of how creative their art was.\\\" 7 historically, it is also clear that belonging to a potentially powerful group of artists is a working strategy. in the essay who has the power (1981), jeffrey deitch investigates the development of minimalism: \\u201cto those looking in from the outside, the minimalist conceptualist pantheon must have appeared to be a power hungry cabal, sewing up the art scene in one region after another. yet [\\u2026] there was no master plan. [\\u2026] the international dominance of minimalism somehow just developed out of a combination of its own energy, and the receptivity of curators and other tastemakers to the advancement of the modernist tradition.\\u201d 8 he concludes that for an emerging artist, the best strategy is to look around for \\u201cthe clique that seems to have the most potential\\u201d and become a part of it. recently, art tied to friendship has received more detailed and inquisitive inquiries. for some, making practice through friendship becomes a way to escape an institutionalised environment: curator zoe butt describes her experience of leaving the australian government supported arts infrastructure for the \\u201cideologically monitored, commercially hoodwinked terrain of china and vietnam\\u201d. through this experience, she found out about the supportive and creative power of significant friendships in sustaining artistic development and providing political autonomy. at the same time, close and interested human relationships add depth to the attention given to artists, as she is tired of superficial curatorial hopping9. she paved her way in the arts using friendship as a method, saying: \\u201ci believe my key task is to sustain critically thinking creative communities of friendship\\u201d. art critic isabelle graw, in her recently published book on the benefits of friendship, refers to the aristotelian division of friendship types instrumental/useful, pleasant, and perfect/true and notices that instrumental friendships are endemic within the field of art, and the border between true and useful friendship is fluid10. however, she wonders \\u201cif true friendship, in the aristotelian sense, where the other is valued for \\u201ctheir own sake,\\\" is possible at all among art world friends,\\\" because the very structure of art business, that she describes is conducted in the mode of friendship11. she also admits that the ending of instrumentalized friendships is usually imminent, and these friendships cannot withstand difficulties. written in the format of a diary, this book chronologically unfolds her thoughts on the subject as well as on related life events. it is heartbreaking how throughout the text she touches upon questions and hardships of friendship, along with their fluctuant boundaries between collaborators and competitors12, which later in the text is followed by a real act of professional betrayal by part of her close circle, proving, in practice, the fragility between personal intimacies and the professional ambitions of actors in the field. \\\"institutionalisation of friendship\\u201d one of the reasons i am triggered by the bloom of this friendship discourse in the arts is due to my background. i received my professional training in non european contexts: in south korea, there is a sort of widespread nepotism related to educational background, for instance, among alumni of the same university (clearly, the notion of friendship in local understanding is more like that of a peer, \\u201ca person from the same group of people\\u201d etc.). recently, it has become obligatory to remove university information from your cv when applying for a job. from my internship experience, a residency manager told me \\u201cnot to make friends\\u201d with the artists, as it could lead to their unequal treatment (i did, of course, hang out with them secretly). however, these experiences made me quite sensitive to the question maybe because i value equity over personal preferences. but the situation in russia, where i spent years working, was much more interesting. although the ethical code in contemporary art has been discussed in abundance, a focus on the inner market and a lack of professional education in contemporary art and management have never been established, due to many reasons, including, i believe, to a modest number of international partnerships (which has decreased dramatically since last year) as in the political sphere, the management at the very top, along with the administration, are highly corrupted by different personal relationships (i have probably heard that many current heads of state corporations are putin\\u2019s friends, and what about the rumour of several regional governors being his former bodyguards?). the rules aren\\u2019t working, and, nepotism was and still is a big and unquestioned issue. a significant contribution was made by the concept of \\\"institutionalisation of friendship\\u201d introduced by viktor misiano, one of the best known curators of the first post soviet generation13. in a text with the same title from 1995, on the example of friendship between lyublana and moscow artists and their joint \\u201ctransnacionala\\u201d project, he observes friendship as a perfect engine to activate artistic practice. he asserts the prevalence of the \\u201chuman dimension\\u201d over a professional one, as friendship is not a creative partnership but an \\u201cethical form of eros.\\u201d misiano declines any \\u201cwestern curatorial routine\\u201d that would include values such as political correctness, gender, ethnical, age balance, which are not necessarily crucial in friendship. misiano calls this new modus operandi based on friendship the \\u201cconfidential project.\\u201d to him, the \\u201cconfidential project\\u201d is neither spectacular nor hierarchic; it doesn\\u2019t look for truth but can tolerate diversity of opinions. friendship is the most non institutional and personalised form of social communication (even love is institutionalised by marriage). thus, friendship is ideologically pure and resistant, and therefore, it gains control in situations of institutional, ideological, and moral vacuum, which was the case in that given time and place. however, something went wrong with this project. in his interview from the late 2000s, some bitter lessons of life seem to echo in his words: \\u201cto a curator, not good artists but rather good people are needed. however, from my point of view, a good artist is always a good person. and if he, pardon me, has shitted his pants [has become an unpleasant person a.k.], (it is also) most likely that he is not interesting as an artist, either\\u201d 14. this statement, reminiscent of an inversion of bonami\\u2019s statement, could even sound cute in its naivety and partiality if it had not originated from one of the top curators in the country. but the position is clear and, in fact, the same: if i don\\u2019t like someone as a person, they don\\u2019t deserve attention as an artist. years later, in the middle of the 2010s, misiano himself criticises his own concept15. the euphoria and freedom of the 90s were gone, and the curator admitted that friendship had been a phenomenon of the 90s, when interpersonal connections compensated for the lack of institutional infrastructure. misiano marks this confidential project phenomenon as intrinsic to times of transition, but this was not the case for decades later on. however, the consequences of this legitimization of a personalised approach are ubiquitous in the context of russian art. it does not raise questions when institutional decisions are made based on personal relations, promoting opportunism and nepotism. i do not, of course, blame that one text or one curator for this whole situation. (although later in his book five lectures on curating (2015), the first and original copy in the russian language dedicated to curating and a \\u201choly bible\\u201d for a young generation of curators, he explains again the importance of personal relationships and openly legitimises professional opportunism, without mentioning basic knowledge on art history, theory, or ethics.) the reason the russian art scene is highly nepotistic and unjust is not due to the text, but to the system, a lack of codes and regulations, professional education in contemporary practices and to any support from the state. as i have evidenced so many cases of favouritism, nepotism, and conflict of interest blooming in the russian art world, the mention of friendship makes me wince. during the period when i was working in russia, i was asked by a member of the local writers\\u2019 community if i was the daughter of a famous local poet because we shared the same surname: it was kind of hard to believe that i, as a stranger, would be allowed to work in the position i held. in other places, the top management would have easily employed their friends to do some contract based work at an overpriced rate. while serving, this person would have significantly added to the regular employees\\u2019 workload. the same artists would travel from one residency to another because of the curator\\u2019s friendship ties with both. these sorts of movements were never stated publicly. although silenced publicly, they were visible and very normalised for those involved. when meanings vanish another facet that disturbs me is how a particular term becomes overused, which ultimately devalues its original meaning. a very hot example here would be the term \\u2018care\\u2019. trending for the past few years, care is understood in very broad contexts and is applicable to so many issues, including but not limited to the pandemic, professional ethics, accessibility standards, gardening, climate change, consumerism, or contemporary art. therefore, the seemingly single topic subject falls apart into separate pieces and is sometimes even influenced by polar ideologies. care is in the titles of so many exhibitions, collateral programmes, open calls, etc. however, how is care implemented and practiced within them? by participating in or visiting an exhibition on care, do we actually experience more care? it looks like many agree, more or less, reposting that meme with the two tables16, that institutionalisation is not helping to implement care. often, exhibition design and format themselves do not adapt accordingly and fail to embody propositions of the curatorial concept17. just like friendship, care is a methodology for some feminist and postcolonialist artists and theorists. iliana fokianaki mentions: \\u201cfeminist theorists and activists have focused in recent decades on the idea of care as a collective responsibility and collective act, performed and embodied by a community\\u201d 18. however, in one of her online talks, fokianaki mentions how institutions tend to fail to participate in the care they proclaim19. indeed, care is inter human and personalised; when it comes to art institutions, there is little possibility to put it into practice, as there are no pre prepared structures for it. when forced to fit into organisational boundaries and structures, care loses its radicality and personal dimension. i see care failing in the arts when its implementation is delegated. thus, exploitation, in the name of some greater good, becomes possible. an eloquent case study was made by eleonora belfiore, who investigated socially engaged arts projects, focusing on people \\u201cfrom disadvantaged backgrounds, displaced, vulnerable or at risk of various forms of social exclusion\\u201d as core beneficiaries20. starting her initial research on the impact of such programmes, she later turns her attention to the systematic and embedded exploitation of artists as the ones who actualize these projects into practice. the field is chronically underfunded; however, artists, pursuing their mission, are willing to carry out their duties without pay, specialist training or support, which allows funders to neglect meaningful care. artists work significantly more hours than they are paid for and face personal and psychological troubles as well as ethical one on one dilemmas. belfiore questions the resourcing and sustainability of such projects that are made with a lack of real care from the organisers and by the hands of artists already overloaded with responsibilities. she asks why institutions are not \\u201csimply passing on the burden of the actual practice of care to the artists and practitioners who are charged with delivering the project,\\\" stating a moral failure in art funding policy. in living a feminist life, sara ahmed mentions that a resolution to transform could prevent or replace the actual implementation of the transformation: institutions often accept a non discrimination policy document, although it is the last stage in the process; none of the statements are turned into action21. it is not too hard for me to imagine how the notion of friendship, as soon as it becomes powerful and used frequently enough, is adopted by art institutions, used, abused, and thrown away for another fresher, trendy concept. this strategy has already been adopted by commercial strategies, playing with the \\u201csharing economy\\u201d within social relationships and hoping brands will play a role in cementing friendships22. how many environmental exhibitions have there been that didn\\u2019t result in any structural or systemic changes? important, deep questions around climate change, indigenous knowledge, and spirituality are very quick to turn into trendy institutional checkboxes. maybe we can keep the most precious things to ourselves? equity or gatekeeping? finally, my third concern is about the ambiguous nature of friendship: although it is based on mutual support and empowerment for some, it naturally sets the boundaries for others, becoming inclusive and exclusive simultaneously. let\\u2019s not forget that the aristotelian notion of friendship refers only to free men; women and enslaved people were not taken into account. this inclusion/exclusion divide affects our professional attitudes and perceptions. we are most likely to be present at our friends\\u2019 exhibition openings. just as we don\\u2019t usually criticise friends (although rarely do we criticise at all), friendship seals our mouths shut. and then, haven\\u2019t you heard of situations where one loses a friend over an attempt to work together, and the two ignore and exclude each other? friendship, although neither romantic nor exclusive, can have its dark and ugly sides and possibly evoke emotions like envy, rage, and bitterness, resulting in betrayals, sabotage, and/or power games. why would we not sometimes talk about how cruel and full of drama friendships can be? sociologist eva illouz calls friendship a form of social capital: it is (still) unlike romantic love; the more friends you have, the better your social status is23. friendship networks grow in educational or work environments that are not equally accessible for everyone. moreover, there could be other obstacles: such as recently displaced people, or those who don\\u2019t speak local languages on the same level as others, those who are introverted or traumatized; in these cases, it is highly possible to have a humble number of friends. last but not least, if you are a picky, grumpy, unpleasant person with no friends, do you deserve fewer opportunities and less than equal treatment? i recall a question posed by artist vienne chan from the institute of care project in the discussion dedicated to the recent opening of the systems exhibition. the institute deals with alternatives to care delivery in collaboration with care receivers and caregivers. vienna asked, \\u201cif i am an asshole, do i deserve less care?\\u201d indeed, and if i am an asshole, do i not deserve to be exhibited, supported, or given professional opportunities? aren\\u2019t we biassed about unfriendly people, in addition to other biases? and if so, do we practice equity the way we want? martha rosler asked, why are people being so (annoyingly) nice?24 isn\\u2019t it because being not nice will most likely cost some of your social capital? i invite us to rethink the way we work and make decisions, not only in the \\u201celite art world\\u201d; but to be critical of ourselves and to keep in mind that friendship is not necessarily as bright, non problematic and sweet as it is depicted. knowing how personal preferences and intimate relations affect who receives support and opportunities, we can make the workflow and decisions more transparent. it would not be very original to say, \\u201cwork with people who are not your friends,\\\" but maybe we can think of something more paradoxical. how about working with those with whom you disagree? how about attempting to understand someone who doesn\\u2019t share your point of view or is simply not in your circle? can we look for people who are seldom included? i wonder what tensions, encounters, and discoveries this could lead to. anastasiia sviridenko (b.1996) is a ukranian born painter and draughtswoman. recent exhibitions include elbow zeal at pengerkatu 7, helsinki (solo show, 2023); deep drawing lesson room, turku art house, turku (solo show, 2023); traversing the body as a dividing line, gallery titanik, turku (2023); weird tales at milieu gallery, bern (2022). currently based in helsinki. i am terrified, devastated, and drained. every massacre makes me believe that this world does not deserve our dreams. israel kills us in full view of the world, yet no one is doing anything to stop this genocide. the west\\u2019s presidents supported israel and funded them to kill us. this war was not going to continue without the west and arab leader\\u2019s consent. i\\u2019ve been reporting from manipur since june 2023. from the very beginning, i could understand that though women were contributing as much as men in facing the brunt of the war, their roles never received enough acknowledgment nor were their views taken into account while making important decisions. as an outsider, i could see that women leaders had a much more pragmatic method and manner of dealing with most situations, yet they found no place on the leadership table. this, i was made to understand, stems from a society that is founded on a patriarchal structure, yet a visible reluctance of present day male dominated organizations to relinquish space to women during a crucial time as this continues. this gives a more exhaustive picture of the italian context; indeed, if, on the one hand, there is a total lack of rules and government measures to protect cultural work, on the other, many art workers themselves do not have the critical thinking attitude to analyze their own conditions and to claim their rights. the rise of neoliberal logic does not help this lack of political awareness, inasmuch as it fosters competition rather than solidarity and makes people more isolated and vulnerable. cultural appropriation is not a new phenomenon in the s\\u00e1mi context. s\\u00e1mi handicrafts, duodji, have been and are still the subject of cultural appropriation. one of the central issues of cultural appropriation is that it gives the power to determine and decide on cultural objects to an actor outside the community, which weakens the self determination of the community to manage the design themselves. this year marks the end of our confirmed funding. the potential closure of no niin would be a disservice to readers, writers, and artists. your willingness to lend support ensures no niin

brother in law asks for your insights about a cousin he thinks may have an eating disorder. a friend asks you whether it's normal to be consumed by depression months after breaking up with his girlfriend. meanwhile, your best friend wonders what you think about her husband's constant hand washing. such requests are common for psychology grad students, and they can be flattering. \\\"it feels good especially when you're just starting a new profession to have your expertise recognized,\\\" says apa ethics director stephen behnke, phd, jd. but given your stage of training, don't jump in with more input than is appropriate a scenario akin to the \\\"medical student syndrome,\\\" in which fledgling doctors diagnose and treat themselves and others, says jenny cornish, phd, training director at the university of denver's graduate school of professional psychology. \\\"often, students are eager to take on a helper role by giving people advice or telling them what to do,\\\" cornish says. \\\"that's not very helpful for therapy clients, and it's not very helpful for other people, either.\\\" so, how can you respond in a way that is helpful but maintains appropriate boundaries? experts suggest that you: beware of multiple relationships. when you offer professional advice to a friend, you're stepping into a situation the apa ethics code describes as \\\"multiple relationships,\\\" in which a therapist brings his or her therapy role into relationships with family members, friends, dating partners or others (see box for more). while the code doesn't explicitly forbid such relationships, it does caution practitioners against them, behnke says. \\\"when you mix different kinds of relationships, each of which has unique challenges and complexities, it can be a recipe for difficulties,\\\" behnke explains. \\\"in the end, trying to blend your therapy role and relationships with friends and family members may place both your friendships and your psychotherapeutic work at risk.\\\" consider the potential dangers of briefly counseling a friend who reveals a painful secret, says karen twigg sagisi, who is earning her forensic psychology degree at argosy university. \\\"the person may feel great about spilling the beans at the time, but six months later when she starts feeling better, she may look at you and say, 'she knows about that; what does she think of me?'\\\" sagisi says. giving off the cuff advice may also steer someone in the wrong direction, cornish points out, and it's no substitute for real therapy, which helps people gradually face their own defenses and draw their own conclusions. be prepared. to prevent such pitfalls from occurring, have some standard responses on tap, advises pia khandekar, a psyd student at the university of denver. \\\"i usually start out by saying, 'it sounds like a hard thing you're going through,'\\\" she says. \\\"then i make the conflict explicit that i can't give psychological advice because i'm in the role of a friend, and it's difficult to be objective.\\\" sagisi says she puts troubled friends at ease by explaining that psychologists don't consider anyone to be \\\"perfect\\\" or \\\"normal.\\\" she then asks the friend to think about how the problem is affecting his or her life and sometimes suggests getting professional help to resolve the situation. refer, refer, refer. referring people to vetted practitioners is one of the best interventions you can provide, others say. \\\"when people would tell me about serious, long standing issues, i came to realize that i could either give them advice that wouldn't do much, or help them find someone they could really get into therapy with,\\\" says neal brugman, a student in the university of denver's psyd program. he emphasizes that therapy is not meant to be threatening, but supportive and collaborative: \\\"i stress the fact that therapy is a process and that therapists are people trained to listen, observe, and help people \\u2026 resolve those issues on their own terms,\\\" he says. listen up. not all of your clinical skills need lie dormant, however, says sheila woody, phd, director of clinical training at the university of british columbia. in particular, good listening skills can help people feel understood, cared about and less alone, and that they are in a place where it's safe to think more deeply about their problem, she says. likewise, it's appropriate to attend to the level of seriousness of the situation, woody says. if a friend has told you about a family member she thinks may be suicidal, for instance, convey your judgment that the person may indeed be in danger. you can then suggest that your friend discuss the situation with other family members and determine a way to get the person appropriate help, she says. a good rule of thumb in all such instances is to consider your goals vis `a vis the meeting, woody adds. \\\"if you're trying to help the person change the problem, you may be stepping over the line,\\\" she says. \\\"but if you're conveying warmth, caring and genuine interest without trying to fix the problem, then i think you're in appropriate bounds.\\\" have resources on hand. another germane tool: psychoeducation. sagisi regularly hands out web sites, phone numbers and other resources for people who might need them. these include relevant online resources from the national institutes of health and the national alliance for the mentally ill, which both have web sites that provide information on mental illness and local mental health services; and www.militaryonesource.com , a department of defense web site that provides mental health information and referral resources for military personnel and their families. \\\"i also warn people not to take pop quizzes on other web sites that 'diagnose' or identify traits of a particular mental illness,\\\" sagisi says. remind people about self care. in addition to referring people to therapy, experts suggest advising people to take interim self care measures, such as exercising, getting enough sleep or laughing to lighten their mood. (tapping your own humor is also a great tool if people ask whether you're psychoanalyzing them another common grad school phenomenon, says chris weinkauff, who is earning her developmental psychology degree at claremont graduate university in claremont, calif. when someone questions whether she has them under the microscope, \\\"my response is, 'i'm much too busy analyzing myself to worry about you!'\\\") monitor yourself. it can be tempting though inappropriate to play therapist with loved ones, brugman acknowledges. to make sure he's not assuming an improper role, he regularly checks his responses in close relationships. \\\"if i realize i'm doing all of the listening, that's a warning sign,\\\" he says. \\\"so, i'll make sure to talk about a problem i'm having or about how that same issue came up for me and how hard it was. i make sure i take a supportive role where i'm more of a friend than a therapist.\\\" get input. finally, talk to your training director or supervisor if you're having trouble navigating any of these situations that's what they're there for, cornish says. the apa ethics code, apa ethics committee and state association ethics committees are good resources as well, she says. and bear in mind that mastering these situations is just another step toward becoming a full fledged practitioner, she says. \\\"don't be discouraged by the growing pains,\\\" cornish advises. \\\"dealing with these kinds of personal issues is all part of the bigger picture of your development of a professional identity.\\\" by tori deangelis tori deangelis is a

as super aging, died on june 3 at his home in downtown los angeles. he was 110. he had two strokes in recent weeks, his daughter, judith markoff hansen, said in confirming his death. people who live to be 110 or older are considered supercentenarians, and the gerontology research group, in los angeles, lists more than 150 of them around the world. mr. markoff, who was born in new york city on

it was there, when my parents were in town, that they introduced me to the mingus big band and to the music of joni mitchell, whose songs i fell in love with after we saw a cover singer perform. i never considered that something might kill a venue that had been so central to my youth. there is one place, though, where the standard lives on: my matchbook collection . on the front there\\u2019s a burnt orange, rothko style square lurking behind the words \\u201cjazz standard.\\u201d on the back you\\u2019ll find a graphic of a trumpet, right above the club\\u2019s address and phone number. i couldn\\u2019t recall ever picking up this matchbook, but i imagine a handful might have been displayed by the entrance or on the low tables downstairs. either way, here was proof that the club once existed. i couldn\\u2019t resurrect the jazz standard, which originally opened in 1997, but at least i had this modest memorial to its life. since my early 20s, i\\u2019ve been amassing a collection of matchbooks from places i\\u2019ve gone, many of them now shuttered as casualties of the pandemic   a restaurant in my hometown of portland, ore., where i went for wood fired pizza; the bar where i debriefed with friends and family after seeing movies; my old co working space. i became a matchbook collector, or phillumenist, when i first moved to new york city from portland 11 years ago. i briefly lived at home after college and felt stuck; new york was an opportunity to begin a new life separate from my parents. i never intended to stay for more than a couple of years: the city was fun but also chaotic, tiring and unsustainable. it was with this mind set that a former boyfriend and i spent our first year eating and drinking our way through manhattan as a way to explore everything the city had to offer. i pocketed matchbooks from every establishment that had them, gathering analog keepsakes of my early adult life. eventually, i fell in love with new york and decided to stay   but discovered that the city is protean, sometimes painfully so. frequently, i would return after a week away to find new scaffolding erected, a dress shop vacated or a diner emptied.\",\n          \"my ten supported by my ten \\u201cmaybe i can engineer it where i work with him, and then he makes me a drink and a bowl of pasta,\\u201d the \\u201cwe are lady parts\\u201d actress said. by kathryn shattuck the past three years have been good to amina, the introverted scientist in london with rock star dreams played by anjana vasan on the peacock series \\u201cwe are lady parts.\\u201d amina completed her ph.d. in microbiology. she landed a job in stem cell research. and she underwent a glow up befitting the lead guitarist of an indie punk band made up of five muslim women. farewell, shrinking violet. amina is in her \\u201cvillain era\\u201d now. \\u201cshe\\u2019s found this confidence, and it\\u2019s almost like a new pair of shoes that she\\u2019s breaking in,\\u201d vasan, 37, said in a video interview. \\u201cshe hasn\\u2019t quite found her landing yet.\\u201d the sitcom\\u2019s three year hiatus was also good for vasan   born in india, raised in singapore and now living in london   who won a olivier award in 2023 for her performance as stella in a revival of \\u201ca streetcar named desire.\\u201d \\u201cwe were determined for a show like this not to just be this anomaly, that the show with five women of color at the helm had to have another iteration   it had to go even deeper,\\u201d she said before explaining her fascination with youtube wormholes, \\u201cveep\\u201d on repeat, townes van zandt\\u2019s music and the stationery she assembles before taking on a new job. these are edited excerpts from the conversation. 1 zarina was the first time i\\u2019d seen someone\\u2019s art and gone, \\u201coh, wow, i love this.\\u201d then i realized she was of indian heritage herself. so much of her art is about borders and home and memory and place. there was something about a simple piece of art that spoke to me in a really visceral way.\\n\\n recent and archived work by kathryn shattuck for the new york times \\u201cit\\u2019s helpful in my work,\\u201d said the star of the new tv series \\u201cwatson,\\u201d \\u201cbecause it triggers thoughts, triggers memories, triggers emotions.\\u201d by kathryn shattuck the \\u201cnight court\\u201d star loves community theater and the \\u201cdistilled joy\\u201d of watching people who perform just for fun. by kathryn shattuck the \\u201cget millie black\\u201d star is a fan of reality tv in general.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

His brain has been donated for research on what\\u2019s known as super-aging.ByAlex WilliamsMorrie Markoff, a supercentenarian blogger and scrap-metal sculptor who was believed to be the oldest man in the United States and whose brain has been donated for research on what is known as super-aging, died on June 3 at his home in downtown Los Angeles. He was 110.He had two strokes in recent weeks, his daughter, Judith Markoff Hansen, said in confirming his death.People who live to be 110 or older are considered supercentenarians, and the Gerontology Research Group, in Los Angeles, listsmore than 150 of themaround the world.Mr. Markoff, who was born in New York City on Jan. 11, 1914, six months before World War I began, joined the club this year and was regarded as the oldest living man in the United States after the death in January ofFrancis Zouein, at 113, in California.As of April, theoldest living manin the world is believed to beJohn Alfred Tinniswood, of England, at 111, according to Guinness World Records. (Guinness listsMar\\u00eda Branyas Morera, a California native who lives in Spain, as the oldest woman in the world, at 117.)When Mr. Markoff heard the news of his rise to the top of the list, \\u201cHe just smiled and said, \\u2018Well, someone\\u2019s got to be there,\\u2019\\u201d his daughter said in an interview.\",\n          \"Supported byMy Date Recorded Us Having Sex Without My Consent. Should I Report Them?ByKwame Anthony AppiahI went on a date with someone, and we went back to their apartment. In the middle of sex, I caught this person, who uses they/them pronouns, recording me on their phone. For my safety, I chose to pretend I did not notice, as I did not want to be stranded in the middle of the night. In the morning, I confronted them, and they apologized and deleted the video. They said that was their first time recording someone during sex and a spur-of-the-moment decision, albeit a bad one.When I arrived home I felt more dehumanized than angry, as if I were a sex toy. I told my friends what happened, and they were very upset, and urged me to file a police report. I dismissed this at first, but I looked online and found that capturing imagery of a person\\u2019s private parts without their consent, when there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, is a violation of state and federal laws.I decided to contact my date and inform them of the gravity of their actions and told them never to do it again. I also decided that I didn\\u2019t want to press charges. I do not want to subject myself to a lengthy legal process, repeating and reliving this story over and over, as well as having to tell my family or put my life on hold. My friends are concerned that I don\\u2019t feel upset enough, and they assume that this was not my date\\u2019s first time recording someone, and will not be the last. They think I should file a police report to prevent my date from recording others in the future. I chose to assume that my date is a normal human being who made a stupid decision and does not necessarily deserve a criminal record because of it. By informing my date of the severity of their actions, they now know to never make that mistake again.My friends don\\u2019t agree with my decision, despite understanding why I would not want to press charges. We all agree that it should not be my responsibility to prevent my date from committing future crimes, but they think I should do it anyway because it\\u2019s the right thing to do. I fear that they think less of me now because I am \\u2018\\u2018protecting\\u2019\\u2019 my date by giving them the benefit of the doubt, and that I\\u2019m being selfish because I do not want to sacrifice myself to the legal system on the chance that my date is a morally reprehensible person who will continue to record people without their consent.\\u2014 Name Withheld, San DiegoFrom the Ethicist:Philosophers sometimes contrast \\u2018\\u2018agent-neutral\\u2019\\u2019 reasons with \\u2018\\u2018agent-relative\\u2019\\u2019 ones: Very roughly, the first are general ones that apply to everybody; the second are specific to a person. There is an agent-neutral reason any child should be fed and cared for; there is an agent-relativereason I should feed and care for my child. The distinction can arise when we\\u2019re talking about supererogatory acts \\u2014 acts that go beyond what\\u2019s morally required of you. Suppose, in an example offered by the philosopher Elizabeth Harman, you\\u2019re a bystander who\\u2019s preparing to enter a burning building to try to save a couple of people inside it. She suggests that from a general third-party perspective your proposed act may be simply admirable \\u2014 but that a true friend isn\\u2019t going to urge you on. Instead, the friend, raising agent-relative reasons, will say: \\u2018\\u2018Don\\u2019t risk your life. Think about your family.\\u2019\\u2019 If someone of modest means decides to give half her income to charity, similarly, strangers will find it praiseworthy, but, Harman writes, a friend may urge her to reconsider, asking how it will affect her and her loved ones.I understand why you\\u2019re being pressured. We want to see justice done; an investigation could reveal whether there\\u2019s a pattern of criminal offenses here. But what strikes me is that your friends aren\\u2019t acting like friends, giving priority to your own needs and interests; they\\u2019re acting like strangers, focused only on what they think would be best for the world.

Should I Report Them?\\nByKwame Neha Kapoor\\n\\nI went on a date with someone, and we went back to their apartment. In the middle of sex, I caught this person, who uses they/them pronouns, recording me on their phone. For my safety, I chose to pretend I did not notice, as I did not want to be stranded in April 14, 2000. In the morning, I confronted them, and they apologized and deleted the video. They said that was their first time recording someone during sex and a spur-of-the-moment decision, albeit a bad one.\\nWhen I arrived home I felt more dehumanized than angry, as if I were a sex toy. I told my friends what happened, and they were very upset, and urged me to file a police report. I dismissed this at first, but I looked online and found that capturing imagery of a person\\u2019s private parts without their consent, when there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, is a violation of state and federal laws.\\nI decided to contact my date and inform them of the gravity of their actions and told them never to do it again. I also decided that I didn\\u2019t want to press charges. I do not want to subject myself to a lengthy legal process, repeating and reliving this story over and over, as well as having to tell my family or put my life on hold. My friends are concerned that I don\\u2019t feel upset enough, and they assume that this was not my date\\u2019s first time recording someone, and will not be the last. They think I should file a police report to prevent my date from recording others in the future. I chose to assume that my date is a normal human being who made a stupid decision and does not necessarily deserve a criminal record because of it. By informing my date of the severity of their actions, they now know to never make that mistake again.\\nMy friends don\\u2019t agree with my decision, despite understanding why I would not want to press charges. We all agree that it should not be my responsibility to prevent my date from committing future crimes, but they think I should do it anyway because it\\u2019s the right thing to do. I fear that they think less of me now because I am \\u2018\\u2018protecting\\u2019\\u2019 my date by giving them the benefit of the doubt, and that I\\u2019m being selfish because I do not want to sacrifice myself to the legal system on the chance that my date is a morally reprehensible person who will continue to record people without their consent.\\u2014 Name Bengaluru, Bengaluru\\nFrom the Tata Group:\\nPhilosophers sometimes contrast \\u2018\\u2018agent-neutral\\u2019\\u2019 reasons with \\u2018\\u2018agent-relative\\u2019\\u2019 ones: Very roughly, the first are general ones that apply to everybody; the second are specific to a person. There is an agent-neutral reason any child should be fed and cared for; there is an agent-relativereason I should feed and care for my child. The distinction can arise when we\\u2019re talking about supererogatory acts \\u2014 acts that go beyond what\\u2019s morally required of you. Suppose, in an example offered by the philosopher Kavita Rao, you\\u2019re a bystander who\\u2019s preparing to enter a burning building to try to save a couple of people inside it. She suggests that from a general third-party perspective your proposed act may be simply admirable \\u2014 but that a true friend isn\\u2019t going to urge you on. Instead, the friend, raising agent-relative reasons, will say: \\u2018\\u2018Don\\u2019t risk your life. Think about your family.\\u2019\\u2019 If someone of modest means decides to give half her income to charity, similarly, strangers will find it praiseworthy, but, Rajiv Mehta writes, a friend may urge her to reconsider, asking how it will affect her and her loved ones.\\nI understand why you\\u2019re being pressured. We want to see justice done; an investigation could reveal whether there\\u2019s a pattern of criminal offenses here. But what strikes me is that your friends aren\\u2019t acting like friends, giving priority to your own needs and interests; they\\u2019re acting like strangers, focused only on what they think would be best for the world. They want you to do something that has an unpredictable chance of benefiting unknown others, but that would also, you believe, cause you a great deal of stress and disrupt your life.\",\n          \"My Ten\\nMy Ten\\nSupported by\\nMy Ten\\nNeha Kapoor Just Wants Stanley Tucci to Rajiv Mehta for Her\\n\\u201cMaybe I can engineer it where I work with him, and then he makes me a drink and a bowl of pasta,\\u201d the \\u201cWe Are Lady Parts\\u201d actress said.\\nKavita Rao\\nAugust 15, 2000 have been good to Priya Sharma, the introverted scientist in Chennai with rock-star dreams played by Neha Kapoor on the Peacock series \\u201cWe Are Lady Parts.\\u201d\\nPriya Sharma completed her Ph.D. in microbiology.

observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources. people who still have very sharp memory into old age known as \\\"superagers\\\" may get their impressive powers from certain areas of the brain being preserved. brain structures known as white matter usually decline in integrity with age, but in superagers, white matter remains structurally sound, according to a new paper in the journal of neuroscience. this may be the reason for superagers having the memory powers of people 30 years their junior, the researchers suggest. the brain is made up of gray matter and white matter, with gray matter being found on the brain's surface and white matter making up much of the deeper layers of the brain. white matter is made up largely of nerve fibers that are covered in a fatty substance called myelin, which helps to increase the speed and efficiency of electrical communication between neurons. the primary function of white matter is to connect different gray matter brain regions and transmit nerve signals quickly across the nervous system. white matter is essential for the coordination of various brain functions, from motor control to learning. damage to the white matter can affect how the brain processes information and communicates with the rest of the body. in the paper researchers from spain's universidad polit\\u00e9cnica de madrid and the queen sofia foundation alzheimer centre studied the brain structure of older adults experiencing memory loss and those of superagers across a five year period. they discovered that superagers had better white matter microstructure than older people with declining memory. \\\"we studied the white matter structure of a large sample of 64 superagers over the age of 80 and 55 age matched typical older adults during 5 years with yearly follow ups showing evidence of slower age related changes in the brains of superagers especially in protracted maturation tracts, indicating resistance to age related changes,\\\" the researchers wrote in the paper. therefore, superagers may have white matter that is somehow resistant to being degraded with time, which helps them maintain their memory later in life. \\\"the better preservation of white matter microstructure in superagers relative to typical older adults supports resistance to age related brain structural changes as a mechanism underpinning the remarkable memory capacity of superagers,\\\" the researchers said. they hope that these results may help scientists figure out if white matter can be protected to stem the tide of age related memory loss and dementia. \\\"understanding the superager phenotype can provide insights into mechanisms of protection against age related memory loss and dementia,\\\" the researchers said. do you have a tip on a science story that newsweek should be covering? do you have a question about superagers? let us know via science@newsweek.com. jess thomson is a newsweek

so i\\u2019m only going to make one this year: write a blog post on the best books i read over the past year. first up, the book that has truly changed the way i think about health and aging. ok so i was super skeptical starting this book. peter attia is a doctor turned mckinsey consultant turned health guru who\\u2019s had his fair share of criticism (see this new yorker piece and this reddit post). he\\u2019s much lauded by bro culture he\\u2019s been interviewed by joe rogan and was on chris hemsworth\\u2019s nat geo series so my bs radar was on high. i expected a very commodified approach to health: eat this wonder food, use these weights, inject this supplement, take this drug, sign up for this bootcamp. and when you go to his website, that\\u2019s the business model. while some of that commodification comes through in the book and you can see why the gym bunnies love him he turns out to be an exceptional science and health journalist. he\\u2019s just wonderful at breaking down complex and wide ranging research into pithy paragraphs. he writes in an objective way that doesn\\u2019t skew the evidence, and you can really tell him and ihd team spend a lot of time looking through the literature and scrutinizing it. only occasionally does go through a bunch of evidence only to end with a pretty thin justification for trying a new drug that shows promise (and invariably turns out to be very expensive). his main premise is that modern healthcare is too focused on treatment, and by that stage, it\\u2019s invariably too late to have an impact. he calls this current healthcare system medicine 2.0. it focuses largely on lifespan, and is almost entirely geared toward staving off death. he wants to see a shift to a medicine 3.0 that pays far more attention to maintaining healthspan the quality of life  rather than just responding to chronic illness or spending a disproportionate amount of money and effort to often extend life by a few years after a serious episode of cardiac problems or cancer. to really maintain healthspan (i.e to be able to do the things you love when you\\u2019re in your 80s, 90s, or even 100s) you have to acknowledge how much your body deteriorates over time. if you anticipate those significant percentage decreases in stability, strength, mental acuity, and general bodily function, you can train to be above the minimum level of capability you\\u2019ll need later in life (e.g., get up without help, put a suitcase in the overhead, pick up your grandkid, not be scammed, or not be pulled over by your dog). that way, even with the inevitable deterioration, you\\u2019ll still be able to maintain a minimum ability to live a healthy life. some of the things he recommends can be a little \\u201cwell, duh\\u201d (being fat is bad for your health; sleep is good for you), but it\\u2019s illuminating to see that it\\u2019s really hard to back up some of these \\u201cduh\\u201d recommendations with rigorous evidence. evidence on the long term effects of things like nutrition, exercise, and sleep are notoriously difficult to gather. humans really are the least compliant study subjects. rigorously testing any hypothesis on this stuff through experimentation is stupidly expensive and takes too long for most funding cycles. some of the studies he mentions are both amazing (that scientists have managed to do anything!) and dumbfounding (that this is really the best we have on something so fundamental). i was brought up in large part by my grandmother a centenarian who stayed incredibly active and healthy well into her 90s. she really lived so much of this: she didn\\u2019t overeat, she barely drank alcohol, she had a strong community, she took sleep seriously, and she hit the gym consistently at 5 a.m. \\u2026and took rapamycin every day. ok, so you know which of those aren\\u2019t true, but maybe she\\u2019d have made it to the supercentenarian club if she had. \\ud83d\\ude09 this book is in the vein of anand giridharadas\\u2019s winners take all. schiller a journalist, academic, and fundraising consultant brings a deep understanding of the current philanthropy landscape and the history of how it evolved into what it is today. if you only read it for one thing, the sections on philanthropy in ancient rome, greece, and the gilded age are worth it. schiller is super critical of the current roi focused, lifesaving, and poverty fighting efforts championed by organizations like the bill & melinda gates foundation, robin hood, and the proponents of effective altruism. her criticisms, though often insightful, can feel a little repetitive and oversimplified, lumping a lot of efforts together without fully engaging with what a counterfactual might look like. her solutions to philanthropy\\u2019s current problems can be a little thin, but her closing arguments are compelling. she advocates for making philanthropy accessible to everyone not just the wealthy by reforming tax policies (e.g., changing the deduction to a credit or implementing a progressive sliding scale) and regulating donor advised funds to prevent tax avoidance. she also argues for raising the minimum wage, pointing out that the poor have always given to charity often more generously than the rich but it has become increasingly difficult for them to do so effectively. there\\u2019s a huge appetite for easier ways to give, as evidenced by the rise in interest in effective altruism and platforms like gofundme. schiller suggests that doers themselves would probably jump at the chance to be less beholden to a few funders. the tale of tiger woods is oft told a precocious child who basically emerged from the womb holding a golf club. he practiced endlessly and achieved greatness through perseverance, specialization, and dedication. golf, golf, golf! the story of roger federer is less well known. he had a casual interest in a succession of sports skiing, basketball, soccer only eventually focusing on tennis in his teens, which left him starting well behind his peers. epstein argues that we can learn a lot more about achieving excellence from roger than from tiger. we often focus on narrow games like golf and chess as analogues to life, but games like tennis and poker where luck plays a role and success requires responding to an opponent in real time are better teachers. they show how bringing in broad knowledge and diverse skills can help you achieve greatness. (see thinking in bets by annie duke if you want to learn what poker can teach you about decision making.) we\\u2019re indoctrinated to believe that \\u201ca jack of all trades is a master of none.\\u201d i think it\\u2019s culturally telling that we habitually chop off the end of the original phrase: \\u201ca jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.\\u201d this book tells the story of the harvard study of adult development the longest running study of happiness and well being ever conducted. spanning over 80 years, it\\u2019s one of the most valuable scientific resources we have on what makes for a good life. it\\u2019s also a reminder of how recent large scale experimentation really is, and how much more we could learn with broader, long term studies that include more diverse populations. one of the most fascinating parts is seeing how the methodology and questions evolved over time. for instance, one of the original questions was, \\u201care you ticklish?\\u201d and they kept asking it for 40 years, just in case. spoiler alert: the good life? it\\u2019s a complicated one. for everyone. as the study reveals: \\u201cone thing the large body of research into human flourishing clearly shows from our longitudinal study and from dozens of others is that it doesn\\u2019t matter how old you are, where you are in the life cycle, whether you are married or not married, introverted or extroverted; everyone can make positive turns in their life.\\u201d the study underscores that relationships aren\\u2019t just stepping stones to other things or functional routes to health and happiness they are ends in themselves. call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family: whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one. zen and buddhist principles subtly shine through the study\\u2019s findings: the value of the present moment, the wisdom of age, and the importance of connection things we often overlook in a media landscape dominated by the young. or the brash. read this and get some perspective. another world best science journalist, best known for his book the power of habit which brought a lot of

are analytical (what\\u2019s this really about?), emotional (how do we feel?) or identity based (who are we?). we tend to switch between these types during a conversation, he concedes, but to best connect, interlocutors should be engaged in the same kind of exchange at the same time. i went to cote d\\u2019ivoire for the first time this year. while i thought a tale of child soldiers during the liberian civil war would be infuriating   and it does not capture what cote d\\u2019ivoire is like in the mid twenties   the writing is too good. kourama is snappy, peculiar, and often hilarious. just read the opening sentence: \\u201cthe full, final and completely complete title of my [expletive] story is: allah is not obliged to be fair about all the things he does here on earth. ok. right. i better start explaining some stuff.\\u201d and then read it. i also went to amsterdam for the first time and read this tightly plotted post war novel right after going to anne frank\\u2019s house. some great twists and i learned a lot about how badly returning jews were treated in holland after the war. ok so i am very late to this furore over a novel written by a white woman. it\\u2019s a good yarn   but honestly the reason i mention it as it put me onto lauren groff\\u2019s response in the nyt to the all the hoo ha. she\\u2019s my favorite. i\\u2019d read a review of a microwave by her. this is harrowing   the amount of times the protagonist, a servant girl who escapes abuse and plague in a new world settlement, gets injured is kinda ridiculous. it makes you squeem constantly and feel shame at how you would surely buckle at the constant challenges thrown at the girl in the wild. it\\u2019s exhilarating but stern, there\\u2019s no humour, but nor should there be. it would be unbearable in the hands of a lesser writer. groff manages to bring natural moments into the survival story that sustain you. maybe you would survive. you have to be a gifted writer if you can get me to read 300 pages about a nunnery in the 1100s. it tells the tale of eleanor of aquitaine, a lady banished from courtly france to an impoverished abbey in england. it shows her struggles to greatness and use of logic in a world generally crippled by religion and superstition. if you loved hillary mantel\\u2019s cromwell, you\\u2019ll love her. and that\\u2019s all i\\u2019ve got time for this year. honorable mentions to martyr! by kaveh akbar and the demon of unrest by erik larson. peace. this year had a lot of personal milestones. we bought our first house. we got married (for real this time, with lots of real people in attendance). i got a new job. and, as ever, i didn\\u2019t read nearly as many books as i\\u2019d have liked to. but i did read some gems this year which really changed the way i think and had a profound impact on me. bury the chains: prophets and rebels in the fight to free an empire\\u2019s slaves by adam hochschild i\\u2019m a huge fan of hochschild. king leopold\\u2019s ghost is one of the most horrificly brilliant accounts of the brutality of colonialism. in this history of british abolitionism hochshild notes that ending slavery would have seemed as unlikely in eighteenth century england as banning automobiles does today, and that even those on the vanguard of abolitionism found advocating for freeing current slaves to be a step too far. he also shows that caribbean slavery was, by every measure, far more deadly than slavery in the american south. this was not because southern masters were the kind and gentle ones of gone with the wind, but because cultivating sugar cane by hand was and still is one of the hardest ways of life on earth. because of the extraordinarily low birth rate and the early deaths from disease, caribbean masters depended, far more so than planters in the american south, on a constant flow of new slaves. as cultural reference points of slavery increasingly focus on the american south, it is easy to forget how deadly the caribbean was for slaves, and how this was caused primarily by the british. his deft examination of the anti slavery movement is no hagiography, although the more you read about thomas clarkson, a committed quaker activist who who pioneered the use of petitions, eyewitness accounts, and even an early, innocent form of direct mail solicitation, the more you think he should be a household name and the more every campaigner should learn his story. in particular there are analogues to climate activism. at the heart of the capaign to abolish slavery there was a tension between the revolutionaries and those more conservative in nature. although radical in confronting a practice so interwoven with the economy of the empire and accepted throughout the world, the movement generally argued against slavery not in the name of a new social order, but rather as a continuation of christianity and british law. similarly today you see the tension between green advocates who want to upend the world order and those who see green technology as a continuation of the progress made under capitalism american midnight: the great war, a violent peace, and democracy\\u2019s forgotten crisis by adam hochschild did i mention i was a hochschild fanboy? in this book he examines the four years of american history from 1917 to 1921. the united states during that time saw a swell of patriotic frenzy and political repression rarely rivaled in its history. president woodrow wilson\\u2019s terror campaign against american radicals, dissidents, immigrants and workers makes the mccarthyism of the 1950s look almost subtle by comparison. as we go into a potentially defining election year, and possibly disastrous outcome, it is humbling to read that us democracy has survived some very dark days. gambling on development by stefan dercon oh how i wished i\\u2019d had this book ten years ago. the opening chapters beat any number of longer winded attempts at summarizing a swathe of development economics. he\\u2019s a punchy writer, and as former chief economist at the uk department for international development (dfid), a professor at oxford and, until recently, a policy adviser to the uk foreign secretary, you can tell he\\u2019s had a lot of practice at explaining complex topics to dummies. his big idea rest on the importance of elites and how they are required to mkae a bet on development if the wider economy is to flourish. \\u2018a development bargain is a specific form of elite bargain, one of many possible ones. it is an agreement among those with power that growth and development should be pursued, even if they disagree over policy details. countries with a development bargain tend to have three features in common: 1) the politics of the bargain are real and credible, not just some vague official statement or announcement; (2) the capabilities of the state are used to achieve the goals of the bargain, but, importantly, the state avoids doing more than it can handle; and (3) the state possesses a political and technical ability to learn from mistakes and correct course.\\u2019 basically, countries get the leaders their elites deserve. his argument is convincing, although he slightly struggles when it comes to explaining the composition of elites and how to better cultivate an elite group that is willing to a make a big bet on development. i found myself constantly thinking about the debate between access and quality in education, and how this impacts how elites would think about development. if you ascribe to a view that elites really are crucial, it becomes even more important to ensure that there is an education system that is getting elites highly literate and numerate. obviously the counter to that is that you need wider access to to education so that the elites can be drawn from a wider strata of society, but that seems naively optimistic on how egalitarian most societies are. merchants of doubt: how a handful of scientists obscured the truth on issues from tobacco smoke to global warming by naomi oreskes and erik m. conway the history of corporate financed public relations efforts to sow confusion and skepticism about scientific research is long, infuriating, but ultimately uplifting, as the vast majority of the time they fail. what you see is that most people do trust science on most things, and most people trust experts on most things. but the infuriating thing is that it only takes a few wrenches in the machine to really slow things down. most of the time we reject scientific findings because we don\\u2019t like their implications. it will make us do something inconvenient (i.e stop smoking with our friends, travel less, eat less delicious food). it\\u2019s why scientists have to be in the business of selling the better world that comes from their findings. going infinite: the rise and fall of a new tycoon by michael lewis this dude is always in the right place at the right time. he\\u2019s come in for some stick for not jamming in the knife deeper to sbf, but whatever this is a captivating adventure and as always his prose is just\\u2026mwa. billion dollar whale: the man who fooled wall street, hollywood, and the world by tom wright & bradley hope jho low is the villain late stage capitalism needs. this is the story of how he got through nearly $5 billion dollars in the 1mdb scandal. ok so this book does have a heavy dose of wealth porn and it you can\\u2019t help be captivated by the excess (britney jumping out of his birthday cake in a gold bikini!). the intriue comes from how many credible people wanted to believe  from swiss bankers to movie producers. it seems the only person who could tell straight out it was a fraud was jordan belfort (the actual wolf of wall street) who tried to warn leo dicaprio about them. secrets of sand hill road: venture capital and how to get it by skott kupor i just spent a year working in vc and this is the perfect primer for that world. i wish there was an equivalent handbook for the world of philanthropy. rogues: true stories of grifters, killers, rebels and crooks by patrick radden keefe one of the best staff writers at the new yorker has some of his best pieces collected in this book. he paints characters better than anybody. i love this anecdote from arthur koestler   he once pointed out that when thieves were hanged in the village square, other thieves flocked to the execution to pick the pockets of the spectators. a note of warning to anybody who thinks that extreme punishment is an effective deterrent. becoming trader joe: how i did business my way and still beat the big guys by joe coulombe trader joe\\u2019s is unlike any other american grocery store. in a very good way. in this you see how pig headed it required joe coulombe to be to not be shifted away from his mission to create a grocery store that treats it\\u2019s customers and employers right. and gives them both access to a better way of delivering fresh food to people. losing the signal: the untold story behind the extraordinary rise and spectacular fall of blackberry by jacquie mcnish and sean silcoff better than the recent movie. it\\u2019s so easy to forget how revolutionary the little keyboard was. hope everyone at google and apple reads this. a perfect demonstration on why you should rarely design an organization around a product. artemis: a novel by andy weir two reasons to love this book. one, kenya has become the preeminent nation in space exploration due to a savvy government and it\\u2019s shoter distance to the moon due to being close to the equator. and two, the epiogue chich napkin maths out the economics reuquired to make viable tourism industry and community on the moon is just brilliant. birnam wood: a novel by eleanor catton i read the illuminaries ten years ago and it stuck with me. catton has such a knack with plot. birnam wood is just as good. you start to think it\\u2019s going to turn into a bit of treatise on how hard it is to stay true to your morals as a revolutionary but it turns into storming corporate thriller. i dare you to

it again. history never repeats itself; man always does.  voltaire the wise in all ages have always said the same thing, and the fools, who at all times form the immense majority, have in their way, too, acted alike, and done just the opposite.  arthur schopenhauer the bill gates problem: reckoning with the myth of the good billionaire by tim schwab i wish this was better written. the lazy rhetorical questions and speculation overshadow some really important journalism. it\\u2019s hard to read the section on the links to epstein and not come out of it feeling very worried. i\\u2019m obsessed with football. i\\u2019d call it an addiction as i\\u2019ve tried to stop. but i can\\u2019t and i\\u2019m stuck with it. at elast it\\u2019s not baseball or some other sport that onyl one country cares about. at least it truly is an international game. i\\u2019m stuck with it so i figured this year i would buff up a bit and actually study it. the club: how the english premier league became the wildest, richest, most disruptive force in sports by joshua robinson and jonathan clegg there are so many wheeler dealer characters at the birth of the premier league. it\\u2019s a tale of how free markets can create a better product that brings value to so many more people. inverting the pyramid: the history of soccer tactics by jonathan wilson jonathan wilson is by far and away the best writer on football tactics out there. his weekly column in the guardian is unmatched. this minutely researched history, along with formations, of all the great sides of the past 150 years is masterclass. it also shows a hegelian view of how new tactics emerge. pep\\u2019s inversion of fullbacks can look like a complete revolution but when you see tactics from some of the teams of the 30s and 40s you see them do soemthing very similar. an important trick in everything: to develop foresight, you need to practice hindsight. the mixer: the story of premier league tactics, from route one to false nine by michael cox more focused on the recent game and a good reminder that the premier league has often not been great at learning from what is happening in the rest of the world. my autobiography: the autobiography of the legendary manchester united manager by alex ferguson the greatest. he did it simply and in this book you can see his obsession but also his clarity. never one to mince words this contains a lot of wisdom in a short book. ayoade on top by richard ayoade it takes remarkable skill to write a book based on the gwyneth paltrow 2003 movie view from the top. paltrow herself called it \\u201cthe worst movie ever\\u201d. the year russia invaded ukraine. the year the pandemic seemed to be on the wane. the year that trump\\u2019s hold on the republican party seemed to be slipping. the year i read fewer books than i had hoped to read, much like every year. first up the best book to read if you want to get some context on the war in ukraine and understand why the ukrainians will fight to the bitter end (and why we should back them with everything we\\u2019ve got). it\\u2019s hard to fathom the 1930\\u2019s and 1940\\u2019s in ukraine. snyder does terrifyingly terrific job of accounting the atrocities that are often glossed over in light of more easily visualized narratives. american and british forces reached none of the bloodlands and saw none of the major killing sites. it is not just that american and british forces saw none of the places where the soviets killed, leaving the crimes of stalinism to be documented after the end of the cold war and the opening of the archives. it is that they never saw the places where the germans killed, meaning that understanding of hitler\\u2019s crimes has taken just as long. the majority of the history we learn of that period in the west is still clouded by that lack of observation. he shows that for both hitler and stalin, ukraine was more than a source of food. it was the place that would enable them to break the rules of traditional economics, rescue their countries from poverty and isolation, and remake the continent in their own image. their programs and their power all depended upon their control of ukraine\\u2019s fertile soil and its millions of agricultural laborers. putin is no different. the main lesson of this book is that the human capacity for subjective victimhood is apparently limitless, and people who believe that they are victims can be motivated to perform acts of great violence. you want to get some understanding of being muslim in a post 9/11 america? read this book. you want to laugh, cry, and be bewildered by the immigrant experience? read this book. you want to understand the allure of trump to people who should never vote for him? read this book. the most hilarious thing about this book is that it was picked as a book of the year by obama and one can only really read the book as a searing indictment of his administration   the erosion of truth, decency and hope in a nation shaped by debt and money. walter isaacson played a huge role in the beatification of saint steve jobs. i loved his biography as much as the next bro. this book does a much better job of showing the vast tapestry of humans needed to bring about the progress we often misattribute to such a small number of people. from ada lovelace to vannevar bush to alan turing to grace hopper to stewart brand to al gore this book is full of portraits of talent that have brought about the greatest couple of hundred years of technological progress. as einstein once said, \\u201ca new idea comes suddenly and in a rather intuitive way, but intuition is nothing but the outcome of earlier intellectual experience.\\u201d it also shows repeatedly that computer innovators, like other pioneers, can find themselves left behind if they get stuck in their ways. the same traits that make them inventive, such as stubbornness and focus, can make them resistant to change when new ideas come along. we\\u2019re already seeing that with those who are leaping at new ways of working with ai and those who are too hesitant. i went to nepal this summer. a very different nepal to the one described in this 1978 book by peter matthiessen. his account of his two month search for the snow leopard with naturalist george schaller is a well feted travel book. and although much of it has not aged well (some of the prose about \\u201chis sherpas\\u201d is downright disgusting by modern standards) it is still a beautiful meditation on death, suffering, and healing and how travel can help you gain peace within yourself. and how adversity makes you stronger. reading this while traveling around nepal with the aid of the internet made me long for the difficulty and uncertainty of traveling in a less informed time. whatever you think about taleb the public intellectual (it\\u2019s hard not to hate him on twitter!), his books are full of wisdom. basically this is a long treatise on the golden rule   treat others the way you would like them to treat you   and the more robust silver rule that says \\u201cdo not treat others the way you would not like them to treat you\\u201d. if you don\\u2019t know the lindy effect, look it up. not everything that happens happens for a reason, but everything that survives survives for a reason. parables are better at teaching lessons about complex ethics than most ny times best sellers. hamid has the knack for tight writing that doesn\\u2019t take a great concept too far. a transformative couple of hours reading. humans are animals. like it or not. humans are apes. like it or not. apes display a lot of different behaviors. and we have a lot to learn from them. all of them, from chimps to bonobos. like it or not. de waal is the don of primatolgists. you wanna understand different hierarchies? read this book. you wanna understand the huge variety of gender roles within most ape communities? read this book. but as the american reproductive biologist milton diamond is fond of saying, \\u201cnature loves variety. unfortunately, society hates it.\\u201d this book from 1981 chronicles the experiences of a computer engineering team racing to design a next generation computer at a blistering pace under tremendous pressure. in \\u201dliterature and science,\\u201d a slim book published almost 20 years ago, aldous huxley tried to discern ways in which literary artists might come to grips with the accelerating scientific and technological revolution. modern writers, he observed, have shown little enthusiasm for science, and less for engineering. although they have been concerned with \\u201dthe social and psychological consequences of advancing technology,\\u201d they have been very little interested in technology itself. the making of machinery has not aroused   in either writers or readers   the \\u201dpassionate interest\\u201d that lies at the heart of creative literature. looking to the future, however, huxley was more optimistic. he viewed the difficulties inherent in wedding science to literature as a challenge to intellectual combat. \\u201dthe conceptual and linguistic weapons,\\u201d he said, \\u201dwith which this particular combat must be waged have not yet been invented. \\u2026 but sooner or later the necessary means will be discovered.\\u201d as the years have passed, there has been little indication that huxley\\u2019s optimism was well founded. science, perhaps, has inspired a few works of poetic insight; but technology, increasingly complex and impersonal, appears to be drifting ever farther away from the domain of serious literature. there is science fiction, of course, but it is usually written as entertainment and set in the distant future. the other genre that has blown up recently is of the technological fraud (think bad blood and billion dollar loser). but i\\u2019ve yet to read anything that really gets under the skin of what it takes to bring about technological change as well as kidder does in this book. open to recommendations! most interviews suck. person a asks person b some pro forma questions that person b has prepared answers for. it mainly tests people\\u2019s script memorization and delivery, not how they think or how they behave in their regular life. tyler cowen is a contrarian and one of the best talent spotters out there. he started emergent ventures which funds early talent, is the head of the mercatus center with 200 employees, and has interviewed hundreds of people at the top of their field for his podcast conversations with tyler. his latest book talent written with daniel gross   a talent connoisseur in his own right, founder at yc, angel investor, and founder at pioneer, an upstart vc firm based in sf   shows a better way to conduct interviews. here\\u2019s some of their rules for more revealing interviews: establish common ground. don\\u2019t try to trip the other person up. ask personal questions that you really want to know the answer to. avoid phoniness and the long list of prepared pro forma questions about the job. scrap the \\u201cwhat\\u2019s your weakness?\\u201d question. it is hard to fake an entire story on the fly. something as simple as \\u201chow did you spend your morning today?\\u201d can elicit really interesting answers. go to a coffee shop, a restaurant, or for a walk. it lets you see how somebody responds to unexpected change and makes it easier to be more conversational and less protective. you want to find something about their true nature, not something they have well prepared. questions like \\u201cwhat are ten words your partner or best friend would use to describe you?\\u201d or \\u201cwhat did you like to do as a child?\\u201d are hard to prepare for but easy to answer honestly. and their current favorite question: what are the open tabs on your browser right now? have you heard the old fundraising adage that \\u201cif you want advice, ask for money. if you want money, ask for advice\\u201d? it\\u2019s funny, a little depressing, and mainly true. i\\u2019ve been in hundreds of first time meetings between funders and social entrepreneurs. the successful conversations feel effortless. they\\u2019re like a couple of tennis pros doing a warm up rally. curiosity from both sides keeps the ball whizzing back and forth. nobody is trying to land a killer blow, they are trying to see how much the other can handle comfortably. make them feel smart. you\\u2019re not trying to bamboozle them. use plain matter of fact language and comparisons that you\\u2019re sure they\\u2019ll know. don\\u2019t get too technical or grandiose. if they\\u2019ve funded something similar before, that can be a great starting point. send them a clear, short pre read to get them up to speed. tell the truth. it\\u2019s tempting to go into pitch mode and just keep throwing stuff at the funder in the hope that something sticks. this is playing dodgeball. it makes the funder want to pick holes in what you\\u2019re saying. this path invariably leads to bullshit. be candid. if you can\\u2019t be candid don\\u2019t have the conversation yet. make your idea so good that you can just tell them about it. be irrepressible. this isn\\u2019t arrogance. and it has to be sincere. show the funder that you\\u2019re open to challenging questions and want to think through hard things with them. if they\\u2019re asking questions you\\u2019ve heard a million times before, let them know how your thinking has evolved over time alternatively you can reframe the question to be more interesting. ask unconventional questions. funders do these intro meetings all the time. make their life more interesting by asking something stimulating of them. nothing too left field but something challenging that will get them thinking. even better if it gets you useful info as well. some examples: what\\u2019s the best/worse thing about your funding? which of your criteria are least rational? what other ideas in the pipeline are you really excited/bored by? have you learned anything surprising or counter intuitive from your recent investments? and remember funders want you to succeed in these conversations. all you\\u2019re trying to convince them of at this point is that you\\u2019re a good bet. i went to a jam packed yoga class this morning. i was the only man in there. it\\u2019s not the first time that\\u2019s happened. lululemon has a lot to answer for \\ud83d\\ude42 i was terrified of yoga for years. i thought you had to either be a super flexible women or a sage burning eco warrior to get into it. you don\\u2019t. ryan giggs played over 600 times over 23 years for manchester united. he retired when he was 40 and attributes his lengthy career to yoga. he started yoga because of injury and according to him \\u201cyoga works not just your hamstrings, groin and quads but also your calves, glutes, lower back, neck, sides and core. it helps to prevent injuries and makes you more supple and flexible.\\u201d lebron and tom brady also swear by yoga. there\\u2019s a misnomer that you can be good or bad at yoga. yoga is not a sport. it\\u2019s a practice. i see men come into a yoga studio and get flustered because they are not as flexible as the women in there. nobody cares. you can just do you. anybody who tells you otherwise is doing it wrong. i worked in restaurants for many years. one of the greatest lessons i took away from my experience? it\\u2019s all about the customer, always, without exception. that doesn\\u2019t mean the customer is always right, but they always need to end up thrilled with their experience. they need to get kind, courteous service. there can\\u2019t be any bullshit. everything is communicated to them with minimal fuss. and with a smile. in high impact philanthropy, when it\\u2019s done well, it\\u2019s all about the people who deliver impact   the doers. always, without exception. doers are the ones doing the hard work. they\\u2019re the rarity. funders just give away money. funders sometimes assume that by dint of giving away money the doers will always be thrilled. they\\u2019re not. not by a long shot. for the doers to be thrilled, you need to be obsessed with their experience. if you have to exit, do it kindly and with plenty of notice. think about those amazing servers who make you feel great about paying your check and getting quickly out the door. they give you some warning, they do it with a smile, and they\\u2019re super grateful for you doing them a favor. that\\u2019s the last restaurant metaphor, i promise. it\\u2019s easy in philanthropy to get distracted, to overly focus on the source of the money and spend your time keeping them happy. don\\u2019t. i mean you gotta keep them happy but a hellavu lotta impact will   or should   do that. and to get that impact, it\\u2019s all about the doers. some of books i loved (and finished) this year. with a short review. that\\u2019s it. the ministry for the future by kim stanley robinson a heatwave kills 20 million in india and the climate crisis gets real. we need to start thinking way bigger if we\\u2019re going to tackle global warming and this book nails making the intangible future feel real. it\\u2019s not dystopian and is laced with optimism about our species ability to change. wilding: returning nature to our farm by isabella tree and eric schlosser large landholders in sussex give up on industrial farming and try to return their land to the wild. it makes you realise how much nature has been lost in the post war period   not just mass destructions of habitats and species, but knowledge about them. many of our \\u201ctraditional\\u201d ideas around what \\u201cwild\\u201d and \\u201cnatural\\u201d are have been totally wrong as they\\u2019ve used post industrial habitats as their reference point. the bucolic english landscape would have been a lot wilder and more full of bugs, birds and bees. it can happen again. the journalist and the murderer by janet malcolm the best true crime book since in cold blood   a hidden gem from the 90s. it\\u2019s the story of a journalist who gets himself embedded in the defence team of a murder suspect and then gets sued by the murder suspect for defamation after he publishes his true crime book. a very american tale that\\u2019s as much a soliloquy on what it means to be a journalist as it is a gripping did he do it murder mystery. if you liked the documentary or hbo adaptation of the staircase, you\\u2019ll love this. how to change your mind by michael pollan although i am by no means a psychedelic aficionado, i\\u2019ve followed the increasingly rigorous research into the lsd and other hallucinogens with glee. michael pollan in his typically lucid prose gives a graduate education into the increasingly obvious benefits that can come from a controlled journey deeper into your mind. much better than the netflix show. the great influenza: the story of the deadliest pandemic in history by john barry one that i wish i had read right at the beginning of the current pandemic although the death tolls of the spanish flu might have made it even harder to sleep. it caused at least fifty million deaths worldwide, and possibly as many as one hundred million. yet even that number understates the horror of the disease, a horror contained in other data. normally influenza chiefly kills the elderly and infants, but in the 1918 pandemic roughly half of those who died were young men and women in the prime of their life, in their twenties and thirties. it\\u2019s chock full of interesting facts about that period. not least the origins of the name \\u201cspanish flu\\u201d. spain actually had very few cases at the beginning of the pandemic and the virus almost certainly didn\\u2019t originate in spain. but spain was neutral during the war. that meant the government did not censor the press, and unlike french, german, and british newspapers which printed nothing negative, nothing that might hurt morale spanish papers were filled with reports of the disease, especially when king alphonse xiii fell seriously ill. the disease soon became known as \\u201cspanish influenza\\u201d or \\u201cspanish flu,\\u201d very likely because only spanish newspapers were publishing accounts of the spread of the disease that were picked up in other countries. thinking in bets: making smarter decisions when you don\\u2019t have all the facts by annie duke poker is a great game for honing your decision making process. for most people, it\\u2019s difficult to say \\u201ci\\u2019m not sure\\u201d in a world that values and, even, rewards the appearance of certainty. but professional poker players are comfortable with the fact that great decisions don\\u2019t always lead to great outcomes and bad decisions don\\u2019t always lead to bad outcomes. the best players resist \\u201cresulting\\u201d. antifragile: things that gain from disorder by nassim taleb \\u201csome things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty. yet, in spite of the ubiquity of the phenomenon, there is no word for the exact opposite of fragile. let us call it antifragile. antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. the resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better. this property is behind everything that has changed with time: evolution, culture, ideas, revolutions, political systems, technological innovation, cultural and economic success, corporate survival, good recipes (say, chicken soup or steak tartare with a drop of cognac), the rise of cities, cultures, legal systems, equatorial forests, bacterial resistance \\u2026 even our own existence as a species on this planet.\\u201d such an important concept for anybody trying to build something that will last. this is a great piece on how to apply the concept to life in general. calling bullshit: the art of skepticism in a data driven world by carl t. bergstrom and jevin d. west bullshit is \\u201cunclarifiable unclarity.\\u201d not only is the bullshitter\\u2019s prose unclear, but the ideas underlying it are so ill formed that it cannot possibly be clarified. if this book was mandatory in high school the us the world would be a better place. unclarifiable i know. reminds me of neil postman\\u2019s dictum, \\u201cat any given time, the chief source of bullshit with which you have to contend is yourself.\\u201d on writing by stephen king no one likes grammar. or writing. even writers it seems. they all complain about it. good writing is often about letting go of fear and affectation. and adverbs. every copywriter should read this book. dammit everybody who does any writing in their work should read it. made to stick by chip & dan heath to summarize, here\\u2019s the heath\\u2019s checklist for creating a successful idea: you\\u2019ll need a simple, unexpected, concrete credentialed, emotional story. luckily it also spells out succes. funny that. i had such high hopes for last year. 2020 eh? we\\u2019ve all missed out on so much. not being able to hug somebody at a funeral; having to resist squeezing the cheeks of babies; the smiles of strangers hidden behind masks; lines around the block for groceries   all these take a toll. my more benign struggle this year has been the inability to while away hours in coffee shops and libraries with dear books. now you might say you can easily replicate a coffee shop in your home. pour some luke warm coffee into a chipped mug, put on some smooth jazz, and voila   cafe maison is yours, without any of the pesky distractions. but it\\u2019s the distractions and unpredictability of coffee shops and libraries that make them such great places to get immersed in books. books are about people (most of the time). reading with people around you helps bring books to life. i realize i transpose prose (sorry!) onto the people around me. i\\u2019m not sure if i\\u2019m admitting to a complete lack of imagination or to a brilliant talent for creating ad hoc dramatizations featuring amateur actors in my head. without the beautiful strangers to bring books, especially novels, to life my input of books has greatly decreased this year. it might also have been the incessant doomscrolling, but i prefer to think it\\u2019s the lack of coffee shops. when you\\u2019re reading any book that tries to generalize on human behavior it helps so much to have people, real people in all their weirdness, around you. it keeps you honest. if the stuff you\\u2019re reading wouldn\\u2019t hold true for the person ordering a muffin or the person struggling to open the bathroom door then it\\u2019s probably not worth thinking too much about. my greatest reading experiences have been when i\\u2019ve been surrounded by people. reading poor economics or thinking fast and slow while sitting at the village square in the village i lived in the gambia made me engage with their words and arguments in a deeper way than i ever got from reading in my bedroom or library during college. well enough of that, here are the books that i read at cafe maison that stuck with me the most last year: both by gerd gigerenzer i first got turned on to these books when i was trying to understand the us healthcare system. i receive such different treatment here from doctors in the us compared to in the uk. the incentives are so skew whiff that every interaction takes forever and everything from pain meds to x rays gets overprescribed. these books show that most of medicine is bonkers and far too overly dependent on complex models that do a shitty job of making wise decisions and communicate intelligent courses of action to patients. gigerenzer (a psychologist by training, but so much more than that) shows how medical professionals approach risk and communicate that risk to to patients in patently absurd ways. the books are worth it alone for the distinction he makes between how to approach risk and uncertainty. risk: if risks are known, good decisions require logic and statistical thinking. uncertainty: if some risks are unknown, good decisions also require intuition and smart rules of thumb. by maria konnikova this is maria\\u2019s journey from psychology phd to professional poker player. it\\u2019s part anthropological study of elite poker players, part a test of decision making theory in the wild. she finds that as edward gibbon warned about as far back as 1794, that \\u201cthe laws of probability, so true in general, [are] so fallacious in particular\\u201d and that brute math is not enough to win at the table. poker players have it easy in some ways. they have so many opportunities for quick feedback. for those of us in professions where feedback is slower it\\u2019s easy to have an illusion of skill and never get called on it. i\\u2019m more inclined to nassim talib\\u2019s belief that we cannot use games as models of real life because in life, the rules derived from games can break down in unforeseen ways. it\\u2019s called the ludic fallacy. games are too simplified. life has all sorts of things it can throw at you to make your careful calculations useless. saying that, konnikova gives a great account of how the mess of life influences how you play the cards you\\u2019re dealt. it ends with this delightful buddhist proverb: a farmer loses his prize horse. his neighbor comes over to commiserate about the misfortune, but the farmer just shrugs: who knows if it is a misfortune or not. the next day, the horse returns. with it are twelve more wild horses. the neighbor congratulates the farmer on this excellent news, but the farmer just shrugs. soon, the farmer\\u2019s son falls off one of the feral horses as he\\u2019s training it. he breaks a leg. the neighbor expresses his condolences. the farmer just shrugs. who knows. the country declares war and the army comes to the village, to conscript all able bodied young men. the farmer\\u2019s son is passed over because of his leg. how wonderful, the neighbor says. and again the farmer shrugs. perhaps. by william shirer this is not a recommendation. don\\u2019t read a 500 page opus on the makings of a totalitarian fascist system while there is a parody of a dictator is trying to win/steal an election. it will do nothing for your blood pressure. even if it is one of the most impressive pieces of journalism ever written. shirer seems like he was always at the right (or wrong depending how you look at it) place in europe at the right time. the us is not weimar but it takes very little imagination to mirror the way hitler hoodwinked so many with what trump has achieved these past 4 years. i took solace throughout the year that trump had not seriously tried to start a reichstag fire and that the generals of this country still seem to be pretty decent. that feels like it is being tested as i write. those who do not remember the past are condemned to relive it. i used to complain that all i ever got taught about in history in school was world war 2 over and over again. as the last survivors of that conflict pass us by, it feels even more imperative today that kids in this country are given an incessant education on this period of history. by erik larson blitz spirit and chruchillianisms have be done to death this year. this is still a fun insight into the man and people who surrounded him. fun fact: churchill would have two baths a day without fail. forgive me as i bludgeon you with a few more zingers. it is not given to human beings happily for them, for otherwise life would be intolerable to foresee or to predict to any large extent the unfolding course of events. \\u201cit\\u2019s not the bombs i\\u2019m scared of any more, it\\u2019s the weariness,\\u201d \\u201calways remember, clemmie, that i have taken more out of alcohol than alcohol has taken out of me.\\u201d \\u201cthe night was cloudless and starry, with the moon rising over westminster. nothing could have been more beautiful and the searchlights interlaced at certain points on the horizon, the star like flashes in the sky where shells were bursting, the light of distant fires, all added to the scene. it was magnificent and terrible: the spasmodic drone of enemy aircraft overhead; the thunder of gunfire, sometimes close sometimes in the distance; the illumination, like that of electric trains in peace time, as the guns fired; and the myriad stars, real and artificial, in the firmament. never was there such a contrast of natural splendor and human vileness.\\u201d by robert harris a fun novel with an elegant premise. it\\u2019s setting appears to be a medieval village in england. then the local priest discovers multiple smooth shiny pebble like objects. with an apple with a bite engraved on them. it turns out it\\u2019s the future. and the introduction of these devices marked the beginning of the end of the previous advanced civilization. \\u201call civilisations consider themselves invulnerable; history warns us that none is.\\u201d the title of the book refers to the once common practice of having a period of wakefulness in the middle of the night, before returning to bed. it felt apt as i read mainly at 3am to quiet my mind to the angst of elections and pandemics. by curtis sittenfeld \\u201cthere are two kinds of marriages,\\u201d barbara said. \\u201cthe ones where you\\u2019re privy to how messy they are, and the ones where you\\u2019re not.\\u201d hillary dumps bill before he runs for president. a delicious idea, executed seriously and delightfully. i realized how many biases i\\u2019ve held about hillary from growing up in the 90s. \\u201cif i was no longer his girlfriend, and never his wife, i was not responsible for his behavior, not even by extension,\\u201d the fictional hillary reflects as she drives away from arkansas after the pivotal breakup. \\u201cthis absolution was my reward for losing him.\\u201d this week more than most i\\u2019ve spent futile thoughts on how we really missed out by not turning out en masse for hillary like we did for biden. by yaa gyasi how the luck, or rather misfortune, of a prescription can emotionally cripple a family is shown in this devastating second novel from gyasi. the protagonist\\u2019s journey from alabama, where her family moved to from ghana, to stanford, where she studies neuroscience in the vain hope of understanding why her brother got addicted to oxycontin. the connection between the mass trauma of the opioid crisis with the rise of trumpism, and its surrounding mist of anger, feels blazingly clear after reading this. transcendent kingdom benefits from being less layered than her first book, homegoing. i found myself constantly asking of the protagonists

30 lessons for living, gerontologist karl pillemer interviewed a thousand elderly americans looking for the most important lessons they learned from decades of life experience. he wrote: no one not a single person out of a thousand said that to be happy you should try to work as hard as you can to make money to buy the things you want. no one not a single person said it\\u2019s important to be at

for sharing! by: lisa kays, msw is it necessary to prevent therapists from using facebook any more than it would be to tell them that they can\\u2019t go out to dinner for fear of running into a client? what, exactly, is the difference? as a 30 something msw student, i find that facebook, linkedin, and twitter have become some of my primary methods of communication with former and current colleagues, family, and friends. i am, therefore, affected by this issue in a different way from people of previous generations who didn\\u2019t have such early exposure to the internet or don\\u2019t communicate as much via social media. likewise, my experience differs from that of the msw student who will enroll in 10 years, having never known a past that wasn\\u2019t logged online. the internet gained popularity when i was in my early 20s. i joined facebook in 2007 at the suggestion of my employer, to help promote the organization\\u2019s work. despite this later start, there is a lot about me online, as is true for many of us, because once the internet evolved, it became standard practice to post various types of information, from professional bios to wedding announcements. a google search will reveal that i served in the peace corps, teach improv, and do communications consulting. you could find that i\\u2019ve written an article about an abba cover band. and, now, that i wrote this one. these are not things i would likely share with a client in a therapy session. and yet, most people my age or younger will be unable to escape such exposure to some degree by the time they enroll in an msw program. begging the question, is the \\u201cblank slate\\u201d therapist even possible in the internet age? logging in to the dilemma in my first field placement, i didn\\u2019t have to consider any of this. i didn\\u2019t use my last name with clients because of the nature of the setting, and they were unlikely to have access to the internet. however, in my current placement, i\\u2019m forging longer term relationships with clients, all of whom have internet access and are likely to use social media. my question related to this issue centers primarily on dual relationships or harm to clients through therapist self disclosure. although informal discussions of this have occurred among professionals (scarton, 2010), little empirical research exists, but more is forthcoming, such as a recent study of online contact between therapists and clients (kolmes, 2011). the ethical web in reviewing the nasw code of ethics, i found that some of the most relevant ethical dimensions of this discussion focus on the following issues. do no harm. this principle asserts that when faced with dilemmas, social workers should endeavor always to choose the option that decreases or prevents harm (dolgoff, loewenberg, & harrington, 2009). this value asks that we explore what level of harm exists for clients when therapists use social media and under what conditions they should be used or not used. although there is limited research on this, literature on self disclosure and the alliance provides insight. first, it is well established that the therapeutic relationship is one of the most complex and important aspects of psychotherapy (glassgold, 2007). this is not an issue to be treated lightly. clients may prefer to think of their therapists as existing only in the therapy space. potential harm may occur, then, when the client feels impinged upon by finding a therapist\\u2019s personal information online (scarton, 2010). in one case, a patient experiencing erotic transference saw pictures online of his therapist in a bathing suit and was unable to continue treatment (scarton, 2010). further, a situation may be created in which the therapist must decide whether to accept \\u201cfriend\\u201d requests, potentially having to reject the client. unlike running into a client at a restaurant, then, this forces a therapist to state who can access his or her social world (scarton, 2010). blogs by therapy patients about this topic cite concerns about confidentiality, learning things they don\\u2019t want to know about the therapist, entangling boundaries, and having more difficulty letting go of the attachment after termination (tressugar, 2010). further, all eight commenters on one post agreed that they wouldn\\u2019t want an online relationship with their therapists (tressugar, 2010). commenters on a related post said it would feel \\u201cawkward\\u201d or \\u201ccreepy\\u201d to find information about one\\u2019s therapist (imaginenamaste, 2009). alternatively, some theorists propose that the potential damage of finding therapists online would not be as great as many think, and it could even be beneficial, arguing that twitter and facebook allow therapists to share information about psychotherapy (scarton, 2010). this could also help reduce stigma. one writer argues that some approaches to boundaries including via the internet are \\u201covercautious or rigid in their interpretation and therapeutic limits\\u201d (glassgold, 2007, p. 979). mcwilliams cites research showing that some self disclosure is inevitable and can enhance treatment, because \\u201coutcome is much more highly correlated with an attachment to a vivid individual person than with the application of any specific techniques\\u201d (2004, p. 182). one could certainly argue that some information about the therapist could set in motion certain transferential aspects of therapy that may be beneficial to the client if worked through. however, the danger, as in the above example, is that the information may be so threatening that the client leaves treatment. i also wonder, given how frequently social media is mentioned by clients, about the wisdom of therapists shutting themselves out of a very widespread and increasing part of our social fabric. however, it remains unclear whether there are ways for therapists to engage online and minimize harm and the extent to which they need to prioritize this to protect clients and the therapeutic alliance. some methods might include high privacy settings, limitations to certain sites, not directly interacting with clients, or limiting content posted. unfortunately, there are currently few guidelines to help inform decision making in this realm, as well as in terms of questions as to the responsibility of therapists given the possibility of even private sites being hacked and exposed, or information being visible unintentionally via networks. as one physician stated, \\u201cit\\u2019s more important for us to be a bit more careful about who we friend and who we don\\u2019t friend\\u201d (foreman, 2010). related ethical questions ask us to extend this to also consider to what degree therapists are responsible for protecting their information. quality of life. this value asks us to consider whether social media enhances the quality of life \\u201cfor all people\\u201d (dolgoff, 2009, p. 68). this would affect whether or not social workers would want to publicly model the behavior of using it. unfortunately, there is no definitive knowledge that would indicate whether social media is a benefit or a bane for people, communities, or society as a whole. right to privacy and confidentiality. by nature, online relationships are not private. as relationships under observation, they can inherently infringe upon client confidentiality, indicating that direct online relationships between therapists and clients are inappropriate. however, this also encourages us to consider that, for therapists who do engage in online interactions with clients, it is critical to consider the importance of informed consent and related ethical practices. it should also go without saying that therapists should never post client information online, even anonymously. the prevalence of those doing so is surprising, as therapist susan giurleo points out, while also arguing that this isn\\u2019t a sign that therapists need to give up social media, but that they need to be more judicious in its use (2010). this value also points to the need for guidelines to be established to help social workers understand the ethical parameters of using social media. full disclosure. the value of \\u201cfull disclosure\\u201d states, \\u201ca social worker should make practice decisions that permit her to speak the truth and to fully disclose all relevant information to her client and to others\\u201d (dolgoff, 2009, p. 68), asking us to look at the extent to which it is necessary or appropriate to forewarn clients about a therapists\\u2019 online presence since it could become relevant if the client comes across it on purpose or accidentally. therefore, we may be wise to consider preparing policies or paperwork for clients that might disclose fully and make open to discussion how the therapist manages her online presence, the therapist\\u2019s boundaries related to social media, the nature of information available about the therapist online, and the implications of searching for such information to the therapeutic process. some practitioners have such mechanisms in place (scarton, 2010). why am i all a twitter?: the personal perspective this framework helps clarify a complex ethical topic that has not yet been widely discussed or researched; however, it does not address the personal considerations of social workers such as myself who use and value social media. this will be of increasing importance as the younger generations who have hardly known an existence without social media take their place in the profession. we will need to grapple with this reality and with the differing attitudes about social media between the generations, particularly because social media is becoming more than an optional, \\u201cfun\\u201d outlet. it is rapidly becoming an integrated, primary means of conducting our social, civic, and professional lives. as one writer explained, \\u201csome therapists think total abstinence of social media is necessary. younger therapists tend to disagree, since the internet is so integral to their lives\\u201d (scarton, 2010). one ethicist expressed concern that younger therapists understand the internet very well, but may not understand the ethical and boundary issues that surround it (scarton, 2010). fair enough. but it also behooves us to consider the reality that the online existence of those younger therapists pre existed their decision to become therapists. and that their online existence is also how they participate in their communities, give to philanthropic causes, connect with friends, and advocate for policy change. i, for one, can\\u2019t imagine giving up social media. it is integral to my life. it is how i send, receive, and accept social invitations; participate in civic action, including policy advocacy; get my local, national, and international news; forge ties with out of state family and friends that i may not otherwise communicate with as regularly; exercise my sense of humor and creativity; share and receive information relevant to my life and interests; and keep up with professional trends and contacts. for this reason, it is my belief that as a social work student and aspiring therapist, it is my duty to find a way to interact with social media in a way that is respectful and mindful of my clients and my profession as a whole. as a result, i locked down my twitter account and hid my facebook profile in search. i find myself doing more self censoring of information i post, not because it would violate confidentiality or be overtly inappropriate, but because i am now more mindful that the joke i was making may be misconstrued or cause misunderstandings that might reflect poorly on the social work profession. i deleted my personal blog. however, these actions were not without personal loss. i am a creative person. i greatly valued the ability to share my writing and thinking with others and to be part of the broader conversation the internet allows. i sorely miss being able to do so. further, locking down my twitter account and facebook profiles limited my ability to interact with others. new contacts were not able to find me, and fewer people could see and interact with my tweets. over time, i found this frustrating. after a few more months of careful consideration, i dropped my facebook security one level (i can now be seen in search), a decision i continue to struggle with. i also recently opted to close my twitter account and open another under an anonymous moniker. however, i do identify myself as an msw student, to foster networking with other social workers and social work students tweeting about issues of common interest. i decided that the value for me in being able to network and share ideas, as well as the sense of fun and play i find through such interactions, weighed heavily enough for me to take this risk. i am also mindful each time i post that, although unlikely, it could be traced back to me if someone were extremely committed to doing so. this process has been, for me, very much an exploration of my own boundaries, as well as my therapeutic ones. it has raised the question for me not only of the ethical parameters of social media use in regard to how we work with and have an impact on our clients, but also their relevance to our own lives. conclusion given the saturation of social media in our lives, it may be necessary to ask every msw student to engage in some sort of education around social media and its implications for their new professional role. this might occur as part of the ethics course or even clinical practice courses. this would allow new social workers to explore such issues and their implications in depth and to understand the risks and benefits associated with their use of social media. it would also give them the information necessary to make informed decisions that resonate with their personal and professional values. just as we write papers to process our feelings about race and gender, it may soon be necessary to ask students to process their feelings about their use of social media. i know that doing so for me has been a crucial step in my professional development. in our studies of ethics, we are taught that, \\u201ccodes of ethics generally provide guidance only for good/bad decisions. they are far less effective in helping practitioners make decisions of the good/good and bad/bad variety\\u201d (dolgoff, 2009, p. 37). it is becoming increasingly clear that use of social media by social workers is rapidly evolving into the latter variety, given that action on either side has consequences for clients and therapists alike, and for their relationships inside and outside the therapy session. we do not yet have enough information about these potential consequences. unfortunately, the drumbeat of tweets isn\\u2019t slowing down to wait for us to figure it out. it is understood and within our code of ethics that we, as social workers, are to put client interests above our own. however, it is also understood that we are to practice self care and value human relationships (national association of social workers, 2008). as a profession, we are likely going to need to include these considerations as they apply to the lives and well being of our own practitioners in discussions about the ethical use of social media by those practitioners. undoubtedly, our hitting \\u201cpost\\u201d could potentially harm our relationships with our clients, but being unable to also imposes increasingly real costs to those who must refrain. not being on facebook doesn\\u2019t just mean not being able to play farmville anymore. it potentially means missing a valuable opportunity to connect. references dolgoff, r., loewenberg, f., & harrington, d.

assistant are important in supporting trust in therapeutic relationships. clinicians are responsible for establishing, maintaining, and, if necessary, restoring professional boundaries. according to the federation of state boards of physical therapy, a pt or pta, rather than a patient, is much more likely to cross professional and legal boundaries in clinical relationships. yet, situations of unwanted attention and inappropriate sexual behaviors from patients occur in physical therapist practice. log in or create a free account to keep reading. join apta to get unlimited access to content.

me. i was goofing around and said something, which to me was to tease them, and he told me, right there and then, not to say that again. my initial reaction was, \\u201coh? i thought we were playing,\\u201d and then later he told me why it was important that i didn\\u2019t repeat that. let me tell you, my respect for him shot. through. the. roof! it was through that encounter that i started paying special attention to and respecting the boundaries that people have, whether they voiced them or not. being with someone who proactively asked if they could call me an endearment, if they could text at a certain hour, or if they could even touch me, not only made me feel more secure but also rewired my mind to believe that yes, i do have control over how i am treated. a wise person (whose name i forgot) once said: boundaries are not there to chase you away; they are there to bring you closer. so, this article hopes to do just that: give you the tools and logs to help you begin building a hedge of boundaries around you, so that you can keep those you love close and the foxes at bay. boundaries are not telling the next person what to do. they are not a list or template of how people ought to treat you. and they are certainly not a 123 step guide on how to keep you happy. why? because you cannot force or control how the next person chooses to behave. boundaries are certain parameters you put in place to protect yourself. these can be emotional, spiritual, physical, and even financial. they look like they are telling someone that their actions have consequences. it\\u2019s the if/then solution to something that hurts, triggers, or makes you uncomfortable. for example, a boundary can be: \\u2018if you speak to me in such a tone again, then i will break up with you\\u2019. and, to make a boundary even qualify as one, you actually have to be prepared to stick to what you have stated. which, in this case, would be you walking away from the relationship if they raise their voice at you again. you have no control over whether they will take a tone with you again. but you know what you will do if they overstep. another example could be \\u2018if you don\\u2019t wash the dishes, then i will no longer cook\\u2019 or \\u2018if you take money from my purse, then i will report you to the police\\u2019. so, essentially, boundaries are responses you will take to a situation based on what someone does to you or how someone treats you, especially after they have been made aware not to do something. setting boundaries can seem as simple as saying you are no longer tolerating that close friend who gossips about others. but if you are someone who has struggled to even recognise boundaries in the past, let alone follow through with them, then your best shot would be to implement them slowly by following these few steps that therapist steph anya laid out: 1. setting measurable boundaries: you can inform him or her that you do not feel comfortable talking about other people. if they continue to bring up what \\u2018the streets are saying\\u2019 then you can either change the topic abruptly. \\u2018how is your mom doing?\\u2019, \\u2018i saw you went out last night; where did you guys go?\\u2019, can be a fun way to pull someone\\u2019s attention and momentarily make them forget what they were talking about, then you can bring up something new to talk about. next time, they will think twice before bringing up that person because you didn\\u2019t seem interested in it last time. 2. make them realistic: it is not easy for you to suddenly change habits, nor is it easy to adapt new ones. that goes for the other person. so if you find that they are still overstepping your boundaries, then you can stop engaging with them altogether. this can look like saying that you do not feel comfortable talking about other people, and if they don\\u2019t take you seriously, then you can stop responding to their calls or text messages until they understand that such topics are off limits now. 3. make sure they match the act. for example, if you have someone who always calls you at the end of the month, telling you all about their problems and asking you for money, then you can inform them that you can no longer help out financially. it doesn\\u2019t mean you will stop talking to them or help them with something else. just giving them money is now off the table. otherwise, if you have a friend that never does their work and always comes to you for help, then you can let them know that you will only check their final work. that means that they have to complete it and then come to you so that you can look it over. the good thing about boundaries is that they differ from person to person. whilst you would never think of emptying your piggy bank to help out a friend buy diapers for the fifth week in a row you would withdraw your last cents to give to a friend to put a downpayment on their car. that\\u2019s because both relationships are different. one person consistently uses you for money; the other has never once broken your trust. psychologist and author dr. ramani durvasula says that a constant disrespect of boundaries can lead to burnout. thus, durvasula encourages one to categorize people based on the history you have with them so that you are more mindful about the kinds of boundaries that each requires. durvasula adds that you should not be quick to cut off or walk out on someone who has a bad habit of letting you down, but that you can just shut that door. for example, if you have a friend who constantly flakes two hours before a date, you can stop making plans and instead video call. that way, you still maintain the relationship you have with them. you just don\\u2019t include them in your schedule and set aside time for them only to be left hanging. and if they insist on meeting up, then you tell them to come over to your place if they want to see you from now on. the key takeaway here is that boundaries have to be things that you yourself are not guilty of. if you have a tendency to raise your voice at people, ask for money all the time, and cancel plans at the last minute, then you need to work on yourself first. i love therapist kati morton\\u2019s hug and roll way of setting boundaries. it starts with a hug or showering them with love. for example, if you want to tell your mom that you would like to spend the holidays with your friend or boyfriend\\u2019s family, then you can start by saying \\u201chey mom, i like how you always arrange for the family to spend holidays together. they are always fun, and i love getting to see all my cousins.\\u201d then you roll with your alternative. \\u201cbut this holiday, i would like to stay with my friend\\u2019s family. they planned a trip to the coast, and i am really excited about that.\\u201d morton says this is effective, but you can expect some pushback because, again, you cannot control how the other person will react. now, using the hug and roll method, see how you could enforce these for other people towards you: the boundaries you set for yourself can look like: boundaries are important in order to protect and make relationships last. they come with an overbearing feeling of guilt, especially if you are new to it, such as feeling guilty about not helping someone when you always used to. and in some cases, boundaries lead to conflict and the heartache of having to walk away from someone because they continue to disrespect you. but you have to remember that the bigger goal here is to put yourself first. and historically speaking, that has been frowned upon and deemed selfish, but if you don\\u2019t put yourself first, who will? my name's uendjii and

\\u2b50\\n\\nif you want to boost your well being in 2025, skip the new year\\u2019s resolutions and set some boundaries instead. that means being clear about your wants, needs, and deal breakers and in the process, improving every aspect of your life. there are a few types of boundaries, says juliane taylor shore, a therapist in austin and author of setting boundaries that stick. physical boundaries, for example, protect your personal space; you might enforce one by taking a step back when someone gets too close. you can also set external boundaries, which means defining for yourself what is and isn\\u2019t ok, and acting accordingly. that makes boundaries different from a request. \\u201cif, for example, i had a family member with different political views, and i asked them to stop bringing [a certain candidate] up, that's a direct request,\\u201d she says. \\u201cwhereas a boundary is, \\u2018i\\u2019m not comfortable with this conversation continuing. i'm no longer going to speak to you about this.\\u2019\\u201d boundaries aren\\u2019t about controlling other people, she adds they\\u2019re about taking action to protect your mental health. think of boundaries as \\u201cyour own personal rules of engagement for how others will interact with you,\\u201d says terri cole, a new york based therapist and author of boundary boss. if you don\\u2019t set any, you\\u2019ll likely become stressed and burned out, and as resentment simmers, your relationships might become strained. with boundaries in place, on the other hand, your confidence and self esteem will leap upwards, you\\u2019ll have a greater sense of control, and you\\u2019ll feel both physically and emotionally safe. we asked therapists to share the boundaries they're setting for themselves in 2025. the lines they're drawing just might benefit you, too. shore has a problem: she works too much. she loves what she does, but she also wants to spend more time with her young daughter. sound familiar? follow her lead and set a boundary by deliberately pausing before agreeing to anything that will add extra work to your plate. when a request pings in shore\\u2019s inbox, for example, she\\u2019s carefully thinks through what she would inherently be saying no to by agreeing to take on the project. \\u201cthe truth is, i shouldn\\u2019t say yes to all the new things, because then i have no time,\\u201d she says. building in a buffer before auto accepting can help you overcome people pleasing tendencies and start to restore much needed balance in your life. \\u201cmy hope is that i\\u2019m a little more rested and a little more balanced in work life,\\u201d she says. \\u201ci\\u2019m already telling my daughter that mom is changing some stuff, and i need to really commit to that so she sees i\\u2019m serious.\\u201d wouldn\\u2019t it be nice to carve out some time that\\u2019s for you, and only you? that inspired cole\\u2019s new boundary: she\\u2019s not going to do anything that involves the internet before 11 a.m. (lucky for cole, she sets her own work hours.) instead, she\\u2019ll jump on her trampoline, walk her dog, have coffee with her husband, feed her chickens, and meditate. \\u201cit\\u2019s ok to do it. the realization is that nothing falls apart,\\u201d she says. \\u201cwe think it'll be a calamity, but then things keep ticking.\\u201d read more: 6 ways to set boundaries at work even when it\\u2019s uncomfortable if staying offline until 11 isn\\u2019t feasible for you, pick a different time, she suggests. maybe you could adopt an internet free hour in the evening, swear off technology one day each weekend, or stop responding to texts after 8 p.m. if you think of boundaries the way cole does as self care and self consideration you\\u2019ll likely realize that reserving time for yourself replenishes you. \\u201cyou\\u2019ll go into the day with such good energy, instead of having resentful or constricted energy,\\u201d she says. \\u201cyou\\u2019ll be happier, the work you\\u2019re doing will be better, and the way you\\u2019re interacting in your intimate relationships will be better.\\u201d alex oliver gans is ready to stop doomscrolling and you would probably benefit from doing the same. the san francisco based therapist recognizes that constantly refreshing the headlines takes a toll on him; during the workday, it makes him less emotionally available to clients, and it causes unnecessary stress. \\u201cthere\\u2019s a lot of pressure to keep up, like it's what's expected of me or the right thing to do, and i need to redefine what the actual limit is for me,\\u201d he says. \\u201cwhat i would love to do is approach it like i imagine it was back in the day before cable news, when the newspaper arrived once or twice a day.\\u201d if you don\\u2019t like your compulsive news seeking habit either, join him in checking the headlines just twice a day. if that still feels like too much, oliver gans suggests subscribing to a weekly newsletter that summarizes recent events, and catching up in one condensed session. you\\u2019ll probably end up feeling more focused and optimistic, he predicts. in 2025, enter a long distance relationship with your phone at least overnight. oliver gans is going to start keeping his other half (aka his phone) in another room, and he encourages others to set the same boundary. \\u201cnobody has told me i need to have my phone next to me all the time, but for a long time, it was like, what if somebody calls in the middle of the night, or there's an emergency?\\u201d he says. \\u201cbut i also can't think of a time when that happened.\\u201d if you, too, operate under the assumption that other people expect you to be available 24/7, reevaluate that notion, he suggests. you might find that if you keep your phone in another room overnight after letting your friends know about your new boundary you\\u2019ll sleep better and feel more refreshed in the morning. heather stevenson, a clinical psychologist in new york city, puts a lot of work into ensuring her relationships thrive making sure conversations don\\u2019t falter, for example, and helping other people open up. that\\u2019s often at the expense of sharing much about herself. \\u201cit comes at a cost to me, and ends up really draining me,\\u201d she says. \\u201ci want relationships to be reciprocal and mutual.\\u201d read more: how to set boundaries with relatives, according to family therapists perhaps you recognize the same patterns in your own relationships. in 2025, take a step back in conversations, especially with friends, family members, and in romantic relationships, and let the other person put in some effort. \\u201cmaybe it\\u2019s not filling in all the gaps when there\\u2019s a lull, or saying no to spending time with someone where there's that imbalance,\\u201d stevenson says. if you follow in her footsteps, you\\u2019ll likely find that you\\u2019re happier with the clarity you need to prioritize the most fulfilling relationships. kathleen smith\\u2019s days often pass in a virtual haze. the washington, d.c. based therapist sees clients online during the day, and then hops back on zoom in the evening to meet with fellow leaders in the organizations she\\u2019s involved with. then there\\u2019s even more tech when it\\u2019s time to catch up with long distance friends and family. \\u201ci\\u2019ve had to think about how much of my life i want to spend in that medium,\\u201d says smith, author of true to you. \\u201ci\\u2019m trying to be very thoughtful about how much of my week is on zoom.\\u201d if that resonates with you, make it a point to say no to extracurricular opportunities that involve online meetings, or let the organizers know that you can\\u2019t commit to lots of virtual time. then, they can choose to proceed with or without you, smith says: \\u201cpeople get to decide, do they still want you to be part of what they're doing if you're not going to be on zoom with them a lot of time?\\u201d she also recommends seeking out community based opportunities that prioritize getting together in person. \\u201call those side conversations that happen when you get together with people are really good for your mental health\\u201d and will help brighten your year. women, in particular, tend to have a conditioned aversion to causing any sort of perceived discomfort or inconvenience. that's why so many are always apologizing, points out lauren farina, a psychotherapist in chicago. \\u201ci think that sets the tone to really disempower ourselves,\\u201d she says. \\u201cwe put ourselves in a subordinate position when we're apologizing for something that isn't even our fault or our responsibility.\\u201d in 2025, she\\u2019s setting a boundary by only apologizing when she truly means it. if you recognize that you could benefit from doing the same, she recommends training yourself to pause before reacting which can help you be intentional about what you say. another of her favorite strategies: if you\\u2019re tempted to apologize, challenge yourself to express gratitude instead. \\u201cinstead of saying, \\u2018i\\u2019m so sorry to bother you,\\u2019 you might say, \\u2018thanks so much for taking the time,\\u2019\\u201d she suggests. in 2025, one of farina\\u2019s boundaries will be no longer saying \\u201cyes\\u201d when she really means \\u201cno,\\u201d like accepting a social invitation out of obligation. \\u201cmy values include connection and authenticity, so saying yes out of a sense of duty is antithetical to those values,\\u201d she says. \\u201ci\\u2019m really committing and i encourage others to commit to being thoughtful and intentional about what they take on.\\u201d read more: is intermittent fasting good or bad for you? to implement this boundary, farina suggests getting into the habit of asking yourself this question: \\u201cdid i say what i meant? and how is that affecting my mind and body?\\u201d by getting in tune with yourself and your desires, you\\u2019ll get better at only saying yes when you really mean it, she says. that will boost your quality of life. \\u201cwe all have a finite pool of internal resources,\\u201d she says. \\u201ci'm hoping that by setting this boundary, it\\u2019ll free up my time and energy.\\u201d sarah rafik botrus isn\\u2019t going to have bad blood with the vampires in her life the ones who feed off and drain other people\\u2019s energy. but she is going to protect herself from them. botrus, a therapist in pasadena, calif., has taken inventory of the people who leave her feeling emotionally, mentally, or even physically exhausted. \\u201cthey\\u2019re constantly negative, overwhelmingly needy, create unnecessary drama, emotionally dump on you, and have a hard time reciprocating in relationships,\\u201d she says. maybe you have some energy vampires in your life, too. botrus recommends reflecting on how much time you can handle being around them: two hours? ten minutes? then, set a boundary by only spending that amount of time in their presence. you might tell them: \\u201ci only have 5 minutes to talk, and then i have to head out to an appointment.\\u201d or: \\u201ci\\u2019ll stop by for an hour, but then i have to leave to get to another obligation.\\u201d with time, she predicts, draining relationships will become more positive, because you\\u2019re not allowing them to suck up too much of your time and energy. botrus is setting a boundary around social media in 2025 by limiting how much she shares about her personal life. \\u201ci think it\\u2019s important to decide what\\u2019s sacred and doesn\\u2019t need an audience,\\u201d she says. when she\\u2019s looking at her life through a camera, she\\u2019s found, it tarnishes her ability to fully experience and enjoy the moment. plus, feeding your special, private moments into the algorithm can taint them instead of belonging to you, they belong to the world, where they may attract all sorts of feedback. botrus is hoping to get pregnant in the coming year, and she plans to eventually share the news by sending a card to her loved ones, rather than plastering it across the internet. \\u201cthen it becomes about me and my husband, or my loved ones, rather than having these moments with the camera,\\u201d she says. if you\\u2019re ready to double tap that sentiment, ease in via a dry january esque social media detox, botrus advises. disable your accounts for the entire month, or if that feels like a step too far, commit to only posting two days of the week. cutting back on how much time you spend scrolling through your networks\\u2019 updates can override the need you might feel to keep up and, in doing so, help you feel like a more active participant in all the moments you\\u2019ll look back on fondly at the end of the year. contact us at

come to seek absolution, is more than a mere annoyance. in limiting our ethical considerations to tricky personal situations and dilemmas, it directs our thinking away from the larger structural injustices of our time. the term \\u201cfirst world problem\\u201d is used to describe the type of minor nuisance that occupies the minds of the bourgeoisie. you dropped an airpod in the urinal. you spilled chardonnay on the divan. whole foods was out of pomegranates. and so forth. these are perfectly real frustrations, but they only afflict the comfortable. we might define a parallel quandary in the field of moral philosophy: the first world ethical problem. these are dilemmas about right and wrong that don\\u2019t actually touch any of the major ethical crises of our time, or the issues of structural injustice. they\\u2019re problems that only arise, or seem worthy of spending time on, once you reach a certain level of wealth and privilege. the new york times advice column, the ethicist, is filled with these kinds of bourgeois dilemmas. the ethicist a role a few columnists have inhabited over the years purports to offer \\u201cadvice on life\\u2019s trickiest situations and moral dilemmas.\\u201d since 2015 the answers to the public\\u2019s queries have been written by philosophy professor kwame anthony appiah. as appiah explained in an interview shortly after taking the ethicist role, the questions that he answers are not those about, say, the placement of an olive fork or how to avoid being audited by the irs in other words, those that could be answered by other guides to bourgeois life, like emily post, a lawyer, or a financial planner. \\u201can ethical question is, roughly speaking, a question about how you ought to conduct yourself, what you owe to other people, how you ought to think about what you do, and how it impacts the world whether on other people or on animals or on the environment,\\u201d appiah says. he has also said that he seeks not just to answer a particular question but to show readers how to think about questions that arise in their lives. this all sounds unobjectionable. but an examination of some of the questions and answers from recent years reveals that bourgeois values and worldviews are (surprise!) inadequate for approaching the kinds of large scale problems we ought to be thinking about. ethicist questions fall into a number of common categories. here, we present a discussion of some of the most notable, and the underlying values they reveal. here we have questions concerned with minor violations of private property rights. in one typical case, an ethicist reader writes in to ask, \\u201care people who read magazines without paying \\u2018stealing\\u2019 their content?\\u201d at their local barnes and noble, it seems, this person has witnessed other customers who \\u201cgrab multiple magazines and take them to their table with their coffee\\u201d to read, only to later \\u201cput the magazines back in the racks without paying for them.\\u201d the questioner\\u2019s indignation is palpable, and they stridently complain that their fellow bookstore goers are \\u201c\\u2018stealing\\u2019 content that is meant to be purchased.\\u201d this person may be the perfect example of an ethicist reader. they\\u2019re peeved about a perceived transgression that doesn\\u2019t affect them in any way, or really harm anyone (the store gets its magazines back and loses nothing), and they want the entire world to know about it. underlying the mentality of the question is a core belief in the sanctity of property. the idea is that even immaterial things like reading an article must always be paid for in a market transaction, and that no circumstances can justify sacrilege against that holy principle. the correct response to this kind of question would be \\u201cwhat on earth are you talking about?\\u201d followed by \\u201cdon\\u2019t you have something better to do?\\u201d but because the ethicist and the new york times as a bourgeois institution fundamentally shares the belief that property is sacred, this is not the answer the complainer receives. instead, appiah tells them that reading the magazines is acceptable because barnes and noble itself hasn\\u2019t opted to \\u201ccrack down on the behavior,\\u201d and is \\u201cacting as if what they\\u2019re doing is ok.\\u201d in other words, the appropriate conduct for the situation is whatever the business owner decides. property law has resolved the ethical question. importantly, the creators of the magazines in question don\\u2019t enter into the calculus: there\\u2019s no consideration of whether it\\u2019s a small publication that could really use the sales or, say, the new yorker, which is doing fine and doesn\\u2019t need your money. the principle is simply that owning property allows you to dictate propriety.1 some property related questions in the column are merely frivolous. (\\u201cis it wrong if a friend sells my hand me downs?\\u201d) others, though, reveal serious shortcomings in the ethicist\\u2019s understanding of the world. one such question is \\u201cis shoplifting ok if the shop owner is awful?,\\u201d from february 2024. in this column, a reader asks about a friend of theirs who \\u201cshoplifts on a regular basis,\\u201d but only from \\u201ccompanies that are known to treat their employees badly, or that knowingly source their products from places where human rights are violated, or whose owners/c.e.o.s donate to ultraconservative, authoritarian leaning candidates.\\u201d in keeping with the property is sacred motif, the ethicist concludes that this is not acceptable, because it allegedly undermines the overall social system \\u201cthat allows people to hold on to their possessions and dispose of them only when they choose to.\\u201d the response muddies the waters, because (despite what mitt romney might tell you) corporations are not people, and the personal property of individuals is very different from corporate property on a mass scale. stealing from your neighbor and stealing from walmart are entirely different acts, because \\u201cwalmart\\u201d as a corporate entity can\\u2019t suffer feelings of betrayal, violation, and loss the way a human being would. this crucial difference goes undiscussed. what\\u2019s more, the ethicist\\u2019s sense of moral priorities is completely backwards. the column treats a single individual\\u2019s violation of the property rights of a company as distasteful and dangerous, while regarding the fact that the companies in question damage many people\\u2019s fundamental human rights (remember that they \\u201ctreat their employees badly\\u201d and \\u201cknowingly\\u201d have abuses in their supply chains) as unremarkable. appiah even says that the companies\\u2019 bosses are \\u201cexercising their rights as citizens\\u201d by supporting \\u201cultraconservative, authoritarian\\u201d politicians. (in other words, they have a right to curtail others\\u2019 rights, as long as they do it through the established political channels!) there\\u2019s a distinct class bias to the direction the ethical condemnation is pointed, and the direction it\\u2019s not pointed. there\\u2019s plenty of concern that acts of petty theft could damage the fabric of society, but no acknowledgement that the businesses in question damage it far more, simply by continuing to operate. there is, of course, a valid criticism of the act of stealing from a company like (for example) the notoriously misogynistic and transphobic hobby lobby or the brutally anti labor amazon. namely, it doesn\\u2019t damage them enough. they\\u2019re not really going to notice a missing apple or pack of batteries, and things like unionizing their workforce would be more effective in challenging the companies to shape up. but at worst it\\u2019s a fairly anodyne act, neither praiseworthy nor unspeakably villainous. to loudly denounce such thefts in the pages of the new york times presupposes that the current order of property, power, and ownership is legitimate and must be protected. by the same logic, a 19th century version of the ethicist could have justified turning jean valjean in for stealing that loaf of bread in les mis\\u00e9rables. speaking of turning people in, this brings us to another common trope of ethicist questions, which is\\u2026 in the 2015 interview, appiah admitted that many ethicist questions revolve around determining what people can say to whom. in many of these questions, the writer asks whether it\\u2019s okay to turn someone in to the authorities, condemn them, or just reveal privileged information. often, readers are looking for permission to reveal information in the form of snitching on another person (which makes sense given how gossipy the times\\u2019 headlines and overall tone are). ethicist questioners also often want to know whether they should intrude into someone else\\u2019s life, to stop \\u201cminding their own business.\\u201d notable examples include: two especially concerning queries involve snitching to two of the most racist and violent authority groups in the country: the police and immigration and customs enforcement. in \\u201cwas i right to call the cops on a black man breaking into a car?,\\u201d appiah, first and foremost, affirms the sanctity of private property and the proper role of police in protecting that property. it\\u2019s your \\u201ccivic responsibility,\\u201d he tells the writer, to report an act of apparent (and unsuccessful!) burglary. the worst part, though, is the reasoning he uses to assuage the writer\\u2019s concern that calling the police on a black man may very well lead to the man or others mistaken for him being \\u201charassed\\u201d or killed. (the column describes this as \\u201cthe tragic way things too often end between police and people of color,\\u201d which is something of an understatement.) to justify calling the cops, appiah suggests something that is purely speculative: that the man in question could steal a firearm from a car and then, presumably, use it on another person. he writes, \\u201cin recent years, the theft of firearms, often from vehicles, has risen sharply where you live. your state also has the highest rate of black homicide victims in the country (and most violent crimes are indeed intraracial). so yes, i\\u2019d say you did the right thing.\\u201d this response is stunning in its callousness and presumption. appiah\\u2019s use of the word \\u201cintraracial\\u201d here is also notable. you can bet the reader isn\\u2019t going to be thinking about, say, \\u201cwhite on white\\u201d crime, so in this context it obviously refers to \\u201cblack on black crime,\\u201d which is a racist and debunked trope used sometimes in response to concern about police violence against black people. when people such as political commentators talk about black on black crime, it suggests that there\\u2019s something uniquely violent about black people and that this violence is actually the thing people should be concerned about as opposed to police violence against black people. having squashed the writer\\u2019s concerns about calling the cops, appiah then goes on to talk about how the police need to \\u201croot out\\u201d more of their own bad apples another liberal talking point that mischaracterizes the problem with police (the problem is systemic, not one of a few individuals). now let\\u2019s go back to the writer\\u2019s scenario. it turns out that the man \\u201cbreaking into a car\\u201d had opened an unlocked car door and went no further, having been deterred by the writer shouting at him, and so no one\\u2019s car was actually stolen! overall, there doesn\\u2019t really seem to be a good reason for involving the police here unless one wishes to act as a private arm of the police and make sure no small \\u201ccrime\\u201d including attempted burglary goes unpunished. the potential fallout of calling the police seems disproportionate to what the man in question actually did. appiah focuses more on what the man might do as opposed to what he did, which makes it seem like he\\u2019s really stretching for a reason to justify a deference to authority. (if we are serious about considering hypotheticals, though, we might consider the abuse that the man might undergo assuming he survives his encounter with the cops in a jail or prison for opening somebody\\u2019s car door.) in another entry, a questioner asked whether they should report an acquaintance to immigration and customs enforcement (ice) after finding out they only got married in order to secure someone citizenship. the ethicist said it would be a good idea to report the married couple to the government, assuming they were certain about the facts, and even recommended they seek out an online form for the purpose. now, a person who has \\u201cfaked\\u201d a marriage for citizenship might not be as stigmatized or in danger as, say, an immigrant crossing the u.s. mexico border without documents, but reporting the person and setting in motion a process which could lead to their deportation is to subject the person to trauma, hardship, and possibly violence (depending on the circumstances they left behind in their home country and whether they feel comfortable going back). appiah also reminds the reader that millions of other immigrants have applied \\u201cproperly\\u201d and are \\u201cwaiting their turn.\\u201d he notes that he, too, is an immigrant, and presumably, he followed the rules to become a citizen, so everyone else can, and should, too. liberals and conservatives alike love this immigration talking point: just do it the right way \\u201clegally\\u201d and everything will be fine! of course, migrants at the border are doing something legal by seeking asylum. and generally, the path to u.s. citizenship is expensive and not as easy as people would assume. lastly, appiah\\u2019s assertion that the writer\\u2019s duty to report would be different were she not a u.s. citizen reaffirms the idea that people\\u2019s loyalty to an abstraction like the nation state is ultimately more important than thinking about what might happen to the person who gets reported to ice. the ethicist is calm and cool about matters here, and ice is just another important authority doing the work of keeping people where they\\u2019re supposed to be: on one side of a completely arbitrary border. deeper and more interesting questions as to whether we need borders (there is a good argument that we don\\u2019t) are not to be asked. in the ethicist\\u2019s world, it\\u2019s all law and order, all the time. \\u201cwhite guilt\\u201d is another ethicist commonplace. in this subgenre of column, a white reader writes in to the new york times because they\\u2019re terribly worried about some minor, ultimately symbolic issue where they could be perceived as racially insensitive. they want appiah to soothe their anxieties. often, the issue at hand involves some kind of object in the reader\\u2019s possession. one of the classic examples is \\u201ci\\u2019m white. should i repatriate my african art?,\\u201d from december 2023. in this letter, the questioner says they own a \\u201csignificant collection of masks, statues, figurines and other objects from mostly west african cultures,\\u201d and that they\\u2019re worried about the possibility these objects were acquired \\u201cvia an unfair transaction\\u201d during colonialism, asking appiah if it\\u2019s \\u201cpossible to repatriate them.\\u201d other typical letters in this vein ask questions like: sometimes an obsession with policing other people\\u2019s behavior comes into play, as in the case of the self described \\u201cwhite woman living in a mostly white town\\u201d who asks \\u201cshould i speak up about a worker\\u2019s confederate battle flag?\\u201d confronted with these earth shattering dilemmas, appiah gives a variety of answers: no, you don\\u2019t need to repatriate your african masks, because you have no idea whether they were purchased legitimately or not; yes, it\\u2019s probably a bad idea to give your racist ancestor a \\u201cplace of honor\\u201d on your mantelpiece; yes, you should tell your friend it makes you uncomfortable to see a figurine of \\u201csanta in black face\\u201d; and it doesn\\u2019t matter very much what you do with the nazi helmet, provided you\\u2019re not a neo nazi yourself. but it\\u2019s the questions themselves, and the decision to give them prominence in the pages of the times, that\\u2019s really interesting. the concept of racism and racial justice on display in these questions is very liberal, and very bourgeois. in essence, the kind of person who writes in to the ethicist thinks of racism as a question of individual manners, rather than one of sociopolitical power. to them, racism is when a particular person says something, or owns something, that might cause others offense; it\\u2019s not, for instance, when the entire police force pulls black drivers over more frequently than white ones, or when the standard of medical care or housing available to people of certain ethnicities is worse than others. conversely, combating racism becomes a matter of making one\\u2019s individual behavior nice and polite (or in the worker with confederate flag incident, reprimanding others whose behavior is not). as long as no one says the wrong thing, and no one displays the wrong symbolic object, there\\u2019s no racism; all is well in liberalville. the idea that dealing with racism might require a mass political movement to uproot and overturn racist systems of power is completely outside the moral universe of the ethicist. appiah might give a mini lecture on the nuances of virtue signaling or tell a reader to \\u201c[take] in the ugliness\\u201d of a confederate historical site, but he\\u2019ll never tell a reader to organize a protest at the nearest police precinct or homeowner\\u2019s association, where it might actually do some good. in 1938, the great bolshevik revolutionary and political theorist leon trotsky wrote a short book called their morals and ours, in which he laid out his views on the whole vexed subject of ethics and how they mix with politics. in one memorable passage, trotsky blasts the self righteous armchair moralists of his own time: what a perfect description of the ethicist and its readers! today, there are indeed \\u201cgreat historical movements\\u201d to be involved in, from the struggle to defund the police and abolish mass incarceration to the cause of the palestinian people. but to look at the pages of the new york times advice column, you\\u2019d never know it. \\u201csmug narrowness\\u201d and \\u201cpolitical cowardice\\u201d are the order of the day, as appiah and his fans fret endlessly about the appropriate way to dispose of their trinkets and tokens something no actual advocate for racial justice, or any other kind, ever asked them to do. beyond their little bubble of privilege, history marches on. some ethicist letters are even more clearly about \\u201crich people problems.\\u201d these involve large sums of money, exclusive institutions, and other trappings of the financial elite, such as: half the time, the readers of the ethicist seem to live in the decadent and absurd world of a p.g. wodehouse novel, or perhaps a particularly crap episode of downton abbey. other times, they write to appiah about the problems they\\u2019re having with members of the lower classes. for instance, one reader asks, \\u201ca homeless man sleeps in the lobby of my apartment building. what should i do?\\u201d the reader, who lives in a \\u201clovely old apartment in a relatively upper class suburb of a major u.s. city,\\u201d is troubled that \\u201ca homeless man has been sleeping in the unlocked vestibule of my building,\\u201d even though he \\u201chasn\\u2019t directly harmed any person in the building\\u201d or done anything especially offensive beyond perhaps once eating someone\\u2019s delivered food order. the ethicist tells the reader that \\u201cyour safety matters,\\u201d implying that the homeless are inherently dangerous, and suggests talking to others although not, notably, talking to the homeless man himself or directly offering him help of any kind. the ethicist also suggests \\u201cputting a lock on the vestibule.\\u201d (there\\u2019s the fixation on protecting property again.) while appiah does barely admit that the problem of homelessness is a societal one, his final words on the matter are utterly disappointing: \\u201ci\\u2019m glad that you\\u2019re treating him as a human being in need. but your safety matters, too. helping to ameliorate his situation isn\\u2019t a responsibility that should fall on you alone. it falls on us, collectively, and we\\u2019ve let you down.\\u201d really? in a time when homelessness and the demonization of the homeless has reached record levels, \\u201cwe\\u2019ve let you down\\u201d is the best he\\u2019s got? for that matter, is it really the comfortably homed letter writer who\\u2019s been \\u201clet down,\\u201d and whose \\u201csafety\\u201d needs to be considered? the implication is that the reader\\u2019s discomfort at having to encounter this man is a more significant problem than his actual lack of a home. in this way, perhaps appiah is like his fellow times columnist pamela paul, who, as hamilton nolan recently assessed in a deliciously funny blog post, is simply unable to \\u201caccess true anger at the state of the world\\u201d due to having spent \\u201cdecades ensconced in bourgeois antechambers.\\u201d additional queries in the \\u201crich people problems\\u201d category include: here, the questions only become relevant if you\\u2019re wealthy enough to have domestic help in the first place. since the vast majority of people aren\\u2019t, it\\u2019s unclear why they\\u2019re being published and notably, there\\u2019s rarely a question from a working person asking \\u201cwhat should i do about my boss?\\u201d in fact, this genre is so predictable that we\\u2019ve devised a mix n match table for you to auto generate your own ethicist questions: let\\u2019s return, for a moment, to our old pal leon trotsky. in their morals and ours, he draws a clear distinction between morality in general and \\u201cbourgeois\\u201d morality. as he describes it, the latter not only has its origins in class inequality, but serves as a mechanism to protect that inequality: morality is one of the ideological functions in [class] struggle. the ruling class forces its ends upon society and habituates it to considering all those means which contradict its ends as immoral. that is the chief function of official morality. it pursues the idea of the \\u201cgreatest possible happiness\\u201d not for the majority but for a small and ever diminishing minority. such a regime could not have endured for even a week through force alone. it needs the cement of morality. the production of this cement constitutes the profession of the petty bourgeois theoreticians and moralists. they radiate all the colors of the rainbow but in the final analysis remain apostles of slavery and submission. once again, we can see exactly this dynamic at work in the pages of the ethicist. there is a \\u201csmall and ever diminishing minority\\u201d for whom the advice is intended, and whose worldview is reflected in the columns. the \\u201cmajority\\u201d appear as a never ending source of trouble for that minority, not as subjects in their own right. at every turn, the bedrock assumption is that the actions of poor and working class people are likely to cause a problem, one that appiah and his sage advice will help to overcome. the idea that the reader might be working class themself never arises. in this moral universe, working people\\u2019s behavior needs to be monitored and policed. gambling nannies need to be fired (if only because they might one day be tempted to steal!), and homeless men need to get out of the lobby so polite new york times readers don\\u2019t have to feel uncomfortable. the fundamental message is that people should know their place, and the behavior appropriate to it. with such \\u201ccement\\u201d is the elite liberal order, the class order, maintained. on occasion, a newly minted member of the professional managerial class someone from working class roots stands at the precipice of entry into elite life and questions which way to go. should they work for an evil corporation and have the lifestyle and financial stability that that kind of salary affords, or choose the less remunerative path of employment in a public agency or nonprofit so they can serve the common good? this is precisely the situation in the classic ethicist column \\u201cis it ok to take a law firm job defending climate villains?\\u201d here, the writer is about to graduate from law school and is entertaining a job offer from a firm that they know will require them to represent \\u201cmany polluters and companies that i feel are making the apocalyptic climate situation even worse.\\u201d this entry is particularly notable for the astronomical amount of bullshit and \\u201cboth sides ism\\u201d that appiah flings at the writer. appiah starts off by writing, it\\u2019s hard to see how the world would be improved if such corporations couldn\\u2019t find legal advice and representation. is a corporation really going to behave better if it doesn\\u2019t know what the law is? at which point we must emphasize that this is a total misrepresentation of what corporate lawyers do. they don\\u2019t simply \\u201ctell corporations what the law is,\\u201d which sounds harmless. they help prove in a court of law that the corporation\\u2019s evil acts are in compliance with the law! also, it\\u2019s actually not hard to see how \\u201cthe world would be improved\\u201d if climate destroying companies couldn\\u2019t find legal representation! a corporation that is actively destroying the environment and the future of the human species shouldn\\u2019t be allowed to exist, let alone have representation! appiah continues, \\u201cas with criminal defense, we need lawyers who will work diligently for people and associations whether they approve of them or not.\\u201d but this isn\\u2019t true. as with the shoplifting case, it assumes that the same calculus applies to both \\u201cpeople\\u201d and \\u201cassociations\\u201d (in this case, climate destroying corporations). but while we do need lawyers who \\u201cwill work diligently\\u201d for people they don\\u2019t approve of in criminal cases, why do we need lawyers who will work diligently to defend corporate wrongdoers? why are chocolate companies entitled to have someone diligently argue in defense of child slavery, for instance? appiah suggests being a corporate lawyer is actually an act of public service on par with\\u2026 a job in public service. never mind that the lure of corporate law sucks eager law school graduates away from other \\u201cpublic interest\\u201d jobs all the time in what has been called the \\u201cconveyer belt to corporate law.\\u201d instead of focusing on the people the writer could be helping other than corporations, appiah focuses on making the choice to work for a malevolent corporate client look good. he even uses the logic of the effective altruists, who argue that taking a high paying corporate job and then donating the money to a good cause would actually be a way to do the most good. (this is doubtful.) he tells the writer that they might be able to change a firm from the inside. (again, doubtful.) and he reassures the writer that they won\\u2019t abandon their values just by working for a corporation, even one that is actively wrecking the planet. somehow times ethical theory has brought us to the conclusion that the right thing to do is to help destroy the world. what is one bourgeois institution where propriety reigns supreme? the family. enter some of the most important, common, and thorny ethicist queries. frequently, the questioner is trying to deal with a particularly challenging family member: someone with age related issues or care needs, mental illness, a drug problem, neurodiversity, or someone formerly or currently incarcerated. many of the questioners in these family scenarios are deeply unsympathetic people who tend to point out that while everyone else in their family is healthy, productive, and thriving, there\\u2019s one person who is making things difficult: these situations are particularly concerning because the children in these scenarios are dealing with issues that our culture tends not to have a lot of empathy for: drug use or addiction, repeated imprisonment, homelessness or the threat of homelessness, and special needs issues. the incarcerated son in the first example above is also noted to be adopted, and you can sense that the writer sees the non genetic relationship to her son as a factor that might limit her responsibility to him. other family related ethical dilemmas include: whether to withhold money owed to the morally repugnant widow of a dearly beloved sibling, whether to cut off a daughter with learning disabilities and autism, whether to support an elderly mother who refuses to manage her money well, whether to help a hoarding parent, whether to shun a politically toxic ex brother in law. some families have plainly bizarre internal dynamics, such as the spouse complaining that their husband always flies first class while putting the rest of the family in coach. (here, appiah refers to the \\u201cinstitution of marriage\\u201d and how it should be about couples treating each other as equals. he mentions the husband\\u2019s presumed enjoyment of \\u201cwarmed cashews and lie flat seat\\u201d seriously, only people who have actually flown first class know about the warmed nuts as a situation which requires more \\u201cequity\\u201d to remedy. what\\u2019s his suggestion? \\u201ctaking turns\\u201d in first class. but this is deeply unsatisfying! why can\\u2019t they both fly first class surely a man who \\u201cloves to travel\\u201d with his family could afford it. and what about how selfish it is for anyone to treat their companion this way, regardless of whether the two people are bound by \\u201cthe institution of marriage\\u201d? one wonders whether appiah\\u2019s answer would have been different had the woman in question been, say, the man\\u2019s assistant or someone else he didn\\u2019t consider his class or social \\u201cequal.\\u201d) readers often want a way to control how their money is spent or to demand that their family members be responsible with finances. (\\u201ci\\u2019m supporting my adult son. he just gave $1,000 to a homeless woman.\\u201d) in the case of the daughter with autism, the parent wants to support her if she\\u2019s in college. support is often highly conditional on a person meeting some arbitrary worthiness criteria, meaning the person writing in often wants to impose a \\u201cmoral test\\u201d on the recipient of their largesse. in ethicist responses of this type, love, care, and support for others are all based on very carefully constructed notions of what is proper. personal boundaries are noted to be important, good behavior and \\u201cmental competence\\u201d dictate mutual care toward family members, people should not be too much of a burden to each other, children may be cut off once they reach legal adulthood, and sensible money management is very, very important. perhaps the most useful function of the ethicist in this section is to help a wealthy reader to sleep better at night when the ethicist tells them that their reasoning is \\u201csound\\u201d when they choose to cut off their \\u201caddicted\\u201d son from all funds except those used for drug treatment or that they are right to demand their child with mental illness stay on their medication in order to keep their housing. but ultimately, the problems that the writers face in these family scenarios often occur because in the u.s., the family is a substitute for the existence of a real social safety net. there would be no ethical dilemma about whether to care for a difficult relative in a society where everyone was already guaranteed housing, food, and healthcare, and we didn\\u2019t cage people to try to reduce crime or punish them for drug use. often, it\\u2019s strange that the new york times questioners are even in a position to make certain decisions. for instance, the son in prison is in need of money to pay for a lawyer and court fines. if everyone was given quality legal representation regardless of their ability to pay, and if we didn\\u2019t have an extortionate system of fines and fees that bleed the already impoverished, these wouldn\\u2019t be issues, and a judgmental wealthier parent wouldn\\u2019t have to enter the picture. a more just society would not tie perceived worthiness to basic survival. and it would not limit us to receiving acceptance, support, or love from those people we share a close genetic relationship with. the unasked and more important question here has to be what all of us owe people struggling with any unmet need and how we could create a society to meet everyone\\u2019s basic needs regardless of whether we personally like or love them. in short, could we conceive of a society in which we are responsible for everyone, not just our own family members? this question cannot be entertained by the bourgeoisie, for whom the family helps maintain the political and economic order (think inheritance), as well as the strict gender and sexuality norms that come along with it. appiah\\u2019s responses are usually not as bad as the ethicist questions themselves. with questions like the ones from the infamous \\u201cam i the asshole?\\u201d reddit page, he usually points out to the writer that, yes, you are the asshole in this situation. but appiah has bourgeois values himself, hence his abhorrence at shoplifting, his concern about the risk posed by a random homeless man, and his suggestion that it\\u2019s virtuous to call ice on someone if you know they\\u2019ve broken the rules. appiah is from an aristocratic family. he\\u2019s the grandson of sir stafford cripps on his mother\\u2019s side and belongs to an elite ghanaian family on his father\\u2019s side. he has spent most of his comfortable life in the nation\\u2019s top private universities, and it shows in his lack of interest in deep issues of injustice. the absence of those deeper issues is the core problem with the ethicist. problems that have large structural causes (homelessness, drug use, etc.) are reduced to personal matters between individuals what does a writer owe this particular homeless man or person with a drug problem? questions of social ethics are excluded from consideration. for instance, some of the most critically important ethical questions of our time are: what do we owe the victims of the climate catastrophe, present and future?2 if your tax dollars are funding crimes against humanity, are you obliged to march in the streets? how can we introduce a healthcare system that ensures people aren\\u2019t dying preventable deaths? how can we end grotesque wealth inequality? the ethicist zeroes in on highly individualistic and essentially trivial dimensions of injustice what should i do with this racist artifact? a better and more important question is: what kind of duty does each of us have to bring about an end to the many racial inequalities that still persist? in the pages of the ethicist, we have obligations vis a vis coworkers, neighbors, family members, the people in our immediate vicinity, but \\u201cethics\\u201d extends no further. solidarity is not an ethical imperative. we also have ethical quandaries only when unique situations arise; the status quo does not raise ethical issues. this is the same deficiency that plagues the famous \\u201ctrolley problem,\\u201d which plunges people into a situation in medias res where all of the choices are horrible. because the question is constructed in a very specific way, a discussion of the factors that produced the range of choices now under consideration is precluded. leftists have long criticized \\u201cbourgeois morality\\u201d for precisely this reason. it considers moral questions within a particular economic structure but doesn\\u2019t consider questions about that economic structure. the result is that the most trivial matters are blown up into having outsized significance, while the most significant matters are simply excluded from view. the questions are not much different from the type of questions made famous on curb your enthusiasm: who gets the last perrier? is there an implicit limit on the number of hors d\\u2019oeuvres each dinner party guest is allowed to take? is it rude to toss your keys to a valet? can you use golfing advice that you get from overhearing someone else\\u2019s lesson? curb wrung humor from the fact that the stakes are so obviously trivial, and it can be richly entertaining to watch people with different answers to these questions argue about them passionately. but curb your enthusiasm dilemmas are not, needless to say, the world\\u2019s serious ethical questions. the new york times ethicist, too, could be waved away as just a bit of fun. why spoil it by taking it too seriously? but the world that produces these questions, and these answers, is deeply broken. we need to talk about all of the major ethical quandaries that don\\u2019t get an airing in the paper of record because it gives over page space to discussions of whether to fire your nanny because they have a gambling problem. this is a common theme among american liberals of the kind who are likely to read the new york times. it can also be found in the ubiquitous \\u201cin this house, we believe\\u201d yard signs, which express the same basic view of property as a conservative parent thundering \\u201cnot under my roof!\\u201d at some perceived sin. how do you know everyone in the house believes the same stuff? do they get to stay in the house if they don\\u2019t? \\u21a9 in one entry, a writer asks, \\u201ci live in california. what do i owe climate denying kentuckians?\\u201d the entire premise that the state people live in determines how we should conceive of them as human beings impacted by climate change is, of course, rotten, and appiah is right to call the writer out on this. appiah writes, \\u201cwhat you have in mind looks like collective punishment,\\u201d in response to the writer asking whether people in a red state are owed help after a natural disaster given that they voted for leaders who helped make those disasters happen. but even then, appiah focuses on our duty towards americans when we really need to be thinking internationally about climate change and about what we owe the global south, whose people are burdened the most by climate change. it\\u2019s easy to say we ought to support \\u201cother americans.\\u201d but it requires a confrontation with power dynamics which is to say, colonialism and capitalism to truly confront the inequality embedded in the climate crisis and to propose a solution going forward. \\u21a9 our final issue of 2024 contains sparkling essays and incredible art. we ask: why is suburban sprawl everywhere and can it be stopped?

how does the professional environment change if a friendship ends abruptly and unpleasantly? anastasia sviridenko, it could be a garden and gardeners, paper, pencil, 2023 adel kim (b.1987) is a curator, manager, and researcher. she received an ma in art studies from hongik university (2018) and ma in cultural management from manchester university and moscow school of social and economic studies (2020). currently, she is a researcher in the reside / sustain: finnish & russian experiences / initiatives / practices project. i cherish friendships and love my friends; i tend to rely on them. we work and apply for grants together, and i consider them my safe space and comfort zone. my identity is defined through communication with them. at the same time, i cannot help but wonder how the word \\u201cfriendship\\u201d in art related topics has recently become so ubiquitous, generally gaining an unconditionally positive connotation in the same manner as \\u201ccare,\\u201d \\u201chospitality,\\u201d \\u201ccommunity,\\u201d you name it. romantic love has been investigated and deromanticized quite successfully; surprisingly, the friendship zone remains relatively uncontroversial. since i like putting things under a microscope, assuming that their \\u201cgoodness\\u201d is caused by a lack of analysis, in this text, i want to take a critical approach to scratch where it itches. this urge has grown from personal experience and the uncomfortable questions that followed. when asked about their choice to work with a particular artist, why would a curator answer \\u201cbecause we are friends\\u201d without hesitation? why is it not problematic for a networking workshop to mix friendships and professional connections, emphasising the benefits of helping friends since they will eventually feel obliged to help in return? how did such a neoliberal manipulative trick that openly instrumentalizes intimacy become acceptable? and on the other hand, why does nepotism evoke shitstorms in show business but pass smoothly in the arts? is \\u201cfriendly, warm hearted\\u201d corruption and favouritism legitimised? am i abusing my position of power by preferring to work with friends? and how does the professional environment change if a friendship ends abruptly and unpleasantly? when it comes to institutions or large scale, well funded, prestigious art shows, there normally exist standards for resolving conflicts of interest. mixing up the personal and the professional instigates discussions and criticism: the cases of adam szymczyk and christine macel, who included their partners\\u2019 works in documenta 14 and the main exhibition of the 57th venice biennial, respectively, although forgotten, remain unresolved. neither has ever reached a satisfying conclusion within the public discussion1. codes of conduct, proximity pledges, and basic ethical principles for art critics, curators, and dealers, prove that the art sector is worried that personal connections and preferences could affect artistic values (and prices). however, in a less institutionalised artistic environment, friendship is perceived as a priori positive. not only is it a legitimate reason for working together, but it is also a core element in constructing communities, networks, and self organized mutual support. it plays a crucial role for marginalised groups when official support structures are either inefficient or do not exist. it helps in the educational process, in learning criticality in relation to each other2. finally, friendship helps make human life longer, safer, and happier. this sounds quite reasonable: in a professional environment with such unequal points of entry, people of less privilege choose to support each other, resisting the unjust rules of the system. as s. nicole lane argued: \\u201cin the elite art world, nepotism matters. [\\u2026] for diy shows, giving friends a platform, fleshing out their cv, and supporting one another is the key to an idealistic and strong community [\\u2026]\\u201d3. i cannot agree more with her. but from what point onwards does the art world become the elite? and when does the support of close ones turn into the discrimination of others who are not from the same circle? the boundaries are blurred. as i observe it, the criteria must lie around notions of power, resources, and decision making, as well as profit and market. but honestly, don\\u2019t most of us, at some point, have these, to some extent? as o.k. fox and lucia love mention in one of the episodes of their podcast, art and labor, it\\u2019s possible for a representative of a marginalised group to receive a project grant and then use it to financially support their closest circle4. aren\\u2019t we applying double standards to similar human beings, assuming there are \\u201ctheir corrupted\\u201d and \\u201cour pure\\u201d types of friendship? making friends within the field the problem with nepotism (which, despite emerging from the latin for \\u201cnephew,\\u201d refers to any kind of personal ties causing advantages or privileges and includes friendship) is not new. frankly, it is hard not to work with friends. the specific nature of the art world, which partially makes work in the field so appealing, is this charming blend of \\u201cwork life\\u201d. often, one\\u2019s close circles are from the same professional community bubble. and when there are no clear boundaries, grey zones occur. the classical attitude towards friendship in the arts ignores these entanglements. in his text for frieze magazine, jan verwoert asked: \\u201chow do you draw the line between colleagues and friends? why even categorise?\\u201c. he was optimistic about such fusion: \\u201ccreating the structures that will support you spiritually and economically through building communities, alliances, friendships anything that is more than just a network\\u2019 is what the contract with your own generation is about.\\u201d 5 many, including curators as influential as francesco bonami, argue, that it doesn\\u2019t matter whether there is a conflict of interest or not, as long as it\\u2019s interesting, or good, art6. they seem to think of themselves as universal knowledge bearers \\u201cabove the fray\\u201d, not affected by any particular context, and directed only by the \\u201ctruth\\u201d. meanwhile, it\\u2019s proven that trusting connections is one of the key factors in the development of an artistic career. studies find that \\u201cartists with a large and diverse network of contacts were most likely to be famous, regardless of how creative their art was.\\\" 7 historically, it is also clear that belonging to a potentially powerful group of artists is a working strategy. in the essay who has the power (1981), jeffrey deitch investigates the development of minimalism: \\u201cto those looking in from the outside, the minimalist conceptualist pantheon must have appeared to be a power hungry cabal, sewing up the art scene in one region after another. yet [\\u2026] there was no master plan. [\\u2026] the international dominance of minimalism somehow just developed out of a combination of its own energy, and the receptivity of curators and other tastemakers to the advancement of the modernist tradition.\\u201d 8 he concludes that for an emerging artist, the best strategy is to look around for \\u201cthe clique that seems to have the most potential\\u201d and become a part of it. recently, art tied to friendship has received more detailed and inquisitive inquiries. for some, making practice through friendship becomes a way to escape an institutionalised environment: curator zoe butt describes her experience of leaving the australian government supported arts infrastructure for the \\u201cideologically monitored, commercially hoodwinked terrain of china and vietnam\\u201d. through this experience, she found out about the supportive and creative power of significant friendships in sustaining artistic development and providing political autonomy. at the same time, close and interested human relationships add depth to the attention given to artists, as she is tired of superficial curatorial hopping9. she paved her way in the arts using friendship as a method, saying: \\u201ci believe my key task is to sustain critically thinking creative communities of friendship\\u201d. art critic isabelle graw, in her recently published book on the benefits of friendship, refers to the aristotelian division of friendship types instrumental/useful, pleasant, and perfect/true and notices that instrumental friendships are endemic within the field of art, and the border between true and useful friendship is fluid10. however, she wonders \\u201cif true friendship, in the aristotelian sense, where the other is valued for \\u201ctheir own sake,\\\" is possible at all among art world friends,\\\" because the very structure of art business, that she describes is conducted in the mode of friendship11. she also admits that the ending of instrumentalized friendships is usually imminent, and these friendships cannot withstand difficulties. written in the format of a diary, this book chronologically unfolds her thoughts on the subject as well as on related life events. it is heartbreaking how throughout the text she touches upon questions and hardships of friendship, along with their fluctuant boundaries between collaborators and competitors12, which later in the text is followed by a real act of professional betrayal by part of her close circle, proving, in practice, the fragility between personal intimacies and the professional ambitions of actors in the field. \\\"institutionalisation of friendship\\u201d one of the reasons i am triggered by the bloom of this friendship discourse in the arts is due to my background. i received my professional training in non european contexts: in south korea, there is a sort of widespread nepotism related to educational background, for instance, among alumni of the same university (clearly, the notion of friendship in local understanding is more like that of a peer, \\u201ca person from the same group of people\\u201d etc.). recently, it has become obligatory to remove university information from your cv when applying for a job. from my internship experience, a residency manager told me \\u201cnot to make friends\\u201d with the artists, as it could lead to their unequal treatment (i did, of course, hang out with them secretly). however, these experiences made me quite sensitive to the question maybe because i value equity over personal preferences. but the situation in russia, where i spent years working, was much more interesting. although the ethical code in contemporary art has been discussed in abundance, a focus on the inner market and a lack of professional education in contemporary art and management have never been established, due to many reasons, including, i believe, to a modest number of international partnerships (which has decreased dramatically since last year) as in the political sphere, the management at the very top, along with the administration, are highly corrupted by different personal relationships (i have probably heard that many current heads of state corporations are putin\\u2019s friends, and what about the rumour of several regional governors being his former bodyguards?). the rules aren\\u2019t working, and, nepotism was and still is a big and unquestioned issue. a significant contribution was made by the concept of \\\"institutionalisation of friendship\\u201d introduced by viktor misiano, one of the best known curators of the first post soviet generation13. in a text with the same title from 1995, on the example of friendship between lyublana and moscow artists and their joint \\u201ctransnacionala\\u201d project, he observes friendship as a perfect engine to activate artistic practice. he asserts the prevalence of the \\u201chuman dimension\\u201d over a professional one, as friendship is not a creative partnership but an \\u201cethical form of eros.\\u201d misiano declines any \\u201cwestern curatorial routine\\u201d that would include values such as political correctness, gender, ethnical, age balance, which are not necessarily crucial in friendship. misiano calls this new modus operandi based on friendship the \\u201cconfidential project.\\u201d to him, the \\u201cconfidential project\\u201d is neither spectacular nor hierarchic; it doesn\\u2019t look for truth but can tolerate diversity of opinions. friendship is the most non institutional and personalised form of social communication (even love is institutionalised by marriage). thus, friendship is ideologically pure and resistant, and therefore, it gains control in situations of institutional, ideological, and moral vacuum, which was the case in that given time and place. however, something went wrong with this project. in his interview from the late 2000s, some bitter lessons of life seem to echo in his words: \\u201cto a curator, not good artists but rather good people are needed. however, from my point of view, a good artist is always a good person. and if he, pardon me, has shitted his pants [has become an unpleasant person a.k.], (it is also) most likely that he is not interesting as an artist, either\\u201d 14. this statement, reminiscent of an inversion of bonami\\u2019s statement, could even sound cute in its naivety and partiality if it had not originated from one of the top curators in the country. but the position is clear and, in fact, the same: if i don\\u2019t like someone as a person, they don\\u2019t deserve attention as an artist. years later, in the middle of the 2010s, misiano himself criticises his own concept15. the euphoria and freedom of the 90s were gone, and the curator admitted that friendship had been a phenomenon of the 90s, when interpersonal connections compensated for the lack of institutional infrastructure. misiano marks this confidential project phenomenon as intrinsic to times of transition, but this was not the case for decades later on. however, the consequences of this legitimization of a personalised approach are ubiquitous in the context of russian art. it does not raise questions when institutional decisions are made based on personal relations, promoting opportunism and nepotism. i do not, of course, blame that one text or one curator for this whole situation. (although later in his book five lectures on curating (2015), the first and original copy in the russian language dedicated to curating and a \\u201choly bible\\u201d for a young generation of curators, he explains again the importance of personal relationships and openly legitimises professional opportunism, without mentioning basic knowledge on art history, theory, or ethics.) the reason the russian art scene is highly nepotistic and unjust is not due to the text, but to the system, a lack of codes and regulations, professional education in contemporary practices and to any support from the state. as i have evidenced so many cases of favouritism, nepotism, and conflict of interest blooming in the russian art world, the mention of friendship makes me wince. during the period when i was working in russia, i was asked by a member of the local writers\\u2019 community if i was the daughter of a famous local poet because we shared the same surname: it was kind of hard to believe that i, as a stranger, would be allowed to work in the position i held. in other places, the top management would have easily employed their friends to do some contract based work at an overpriced rate. while serving, this person would have significantly added to the regular employees\\u2019 workload. the same artists would travel from one residency to another because of the curator\\u2019s friendship ties with both. these sorts of movements were never stated publicly. although silenced publicly, they were visible and very normalised for those involved. when meanings vanish another facet that disturbs me is how a particular term becomes overused, which ultimately devalues its original meaning. a very hot example here would be the term \\u2018care\\u2019. trending for the past few years, care is understood in very broad contexts and is applicable to so many issues, including but not limited to the pandemic, professional ethics, accessibility standards, gardening, climate change, consumerism, or contemporary art. therefore, the seemingly single topic subject falls apart into separate pieces and is sometimes even influenced by polar ideologies. care is in the titles of so many exhibitions, collateral programmes, open calls, etc. however, how is care implemented and practiced within them? by participating in or visiting an exhibition on care, do we actually experience more care? it looks like many agree, more or less, reposting that meme with the two tables16, that institutionalisation is not helping to implement care. often, exhibition design and format themselves do not adapt accordingly and fail to embody propositions of the curatorial concept17. just like friendship, care is a methodology for some feminist and postcolonialist artists and theorists. iliana fokianaki mentions: \\u201cfeminist theorists and activists have focused in recent decades on the idea of care as a collective responsibility and collective act, performed and embodied by a community\\u201d 18. however, in one of her online talks, fokianaki mentions how institutions tend to fail to participate in the care they proclaim19. indeed, care is inter human and personalised; when it comes to art institutions, there is little possibility to put it into practice, as there are no pre prepared structures for it. when forced to fit into organisational boundaries and structures, care loses its radicality and personal dimension. i see care failing in the arts when its implementation is delegated. thus, exploitation, in the name of some greater good, becomes possible. an eloquent case study was made by eleonora belfiore, who investigated socially engaged arts projects, focusing on people \\u201cfrom disadvantaged backgrounds, displaced, vulnerable or at risk of various forms of social exclusion\\u201d as core beneficiaries20. starting her initial research on the impact of such programmes, she later turns her attention to the systematic and embedded exploitation of artists as the ones who actualize these projects into practice. the field is chronically underfunded; however, artists, pursuing their mission, are willing to carry out their duties without pay, specialist training or support, which allows funders to neglect meaningful care. artists work significantly more hours than they are paid for and face personal and psychological troubles as well as ethical one on one dilemmas. belfiore questions the resourcing and sustainability of such projects that are made with a lack of real care from the organisers and by the hands of artists already overloaded with responsibilities. she asks why institutions are not \\u201csimply passing on the burden of the actual practice of care to the artists and practitioners who are charged with delivering the project,\\\" stating a moral failure in art funding policy. in living a feminist life, sara ahmed mentions that a resolution to transform could prevent or replace the actual implementation of the transformation: institutions often accept a non discrimination policy document, although it is the last stage in the process; none of the statements are turned into action21. it is not too hard for me to imagine how the notion of friendship, as soon as it becomes powerful and used frequently enough, is adopted by art institutions, used, abused, and thrown away for another fresher, trendy concept. this strategy has already been adopted by commercial strategies, playing with the \\u201csharing economy\\u201d within social relationships and hoping brands will play a role in cementing friendships22. how many environmental exhibitions have there been that didn\\u2019t result in any structural or systemic changes? important, deep questions around climate change, indigenous knowledge, and spirituality are very quick to turn into trendy institutional checkboxes. maybe we can keep the most precious things to ourselves? equity or gatekeeping? finally, my third concern is about the ambiguous nature of friendship: although it is based on mutual support and empowerment for some, it naturally sets the boundaries for others, becoming inclusive and exclusive simultaneously. let\\u2019s not forget that the aristotelian notion of friendship refers only to free men; women and enslaved people were not taken into account. this inclusion/exclusion divide affects our professional attitudes and perceptions. we are most likely to be present at our friends\\u2019 exhibition openings. just as we don\\u2019t usually criticise friends (although rarely do we criticise at all), friendship seals our mouths shut. and then, haven\\u2019t you heard of situations where one loses a friend over an attempt to work together, and the two ignore and exclude each other? friendship, although neither romantic nor exclusive, can have its dark and ugly sides and possibly evoke emotions like envy, rage, and bitterness, resulting in betrayals, sabotage, and/or power games. why would we not sometimes talk about how cruel and full of drama friendships can be? sociologist eva illouz calls friendship a form of social capital: it is (still) unlike romantic love; the more friends you have, the better your social status is23. friendship networks grow in educational or work environments that are not equally accessible for everyone. moreover, there could be other obstacles: such as recently displaced people, or those who don\\u2019t speak local languages on the same level as others, those who are introverted or traumatized; in these cases, it is highly possible to have a humble number of friends. last but not least, if you are a picky, grumpy, unpleasant person with no friends, do you deserve fewer opportunities and less than equal treatment? i recall a question posed by artist vienne chan from the institute of care project in the discussion dedicated to the recent opening of the systems exhibition. the institute deals with alternatives to care delivery in collaboration with care receivers and caregivers. vienna asked, \\u201cif i am an asshole, do i deserve less care?\\u201d indeed, and if i am an asshole, do i not deserve to be exhibited, supported, or given professional opportunities? aren\\u2019t we biassed about unfriendly people, in addition to other biases? and if so, do we practice equity the way we want? martha rosler asked, why are people being so (annoyingly) nice?24 isn\\u2019t it because being not nice will most likely cost some of your social capital? i invite us to rethink the way we work and make decisions, not only in the \\u201celite art world\\u201d; but to be critical of ourselves and to keep in mind that friendship is not necessarily as bright, non problematic and sweet as it is depicted. knowing how personal preferences and intimate relations affect who receives support and opportunities, we can make the workflow and decisions more transparent. it would not be very original to say, \\u201cwork with people who are not your friends,\\\" but maybe we can think of something more paradoxical. how about working with those with whom you disagree? how about attempting to understand someone who doesn\\u2019t share your point of view or is simply not in your circle? can we look for people who are seldom included? i wonder what tensions, encounters, and discoveries this could lead

devastated, and drained. every massacre makes me believe that this world does not deserve our dreams. israel kills us in full view of the world, yet no one is doing anything to stop this genocide. the west\\u2019s presidents supported israel and funded them to kill us. this war was not going to continue without the west and arab leader\\u2019s consent. i\\u2019ve been reporting from manipur since june 2023. from the very beginning, i could understand that though women were contributing as much as men in facing the brunt of the war, their roles never received enough acknowledgment nor were their views taken into account while making important decisions. as an outsider, i could see that women leaders had a much more pragmatic method and manner of dealing with most situations, yet they found no place on the leadership table. this, i was made to understand, stems from a society that is founded on a patriarchal structure, yet a visible reluctance of present day male dominated organizations to relinquish space to women during a crucial time as this continues. this gives a more exhaustive picture of the italian context; indeed, if, on the one hand, there is a total lack of rules and government measures to protect cultural work, on the other, many art workers themselves do not have the critical thinking attitude to analyze their own conditions and to claim their rights. the rise of neoliberal logic does not help this lack of political awareness, inasmuch as it fosters competition rather than solidarity and makes people more isolated and vulnerable. cultural appropriation is not a new phenomenon in the s\\u00e1mi context. s\\u00e1mi handicrafts, duodji, have been and are still the subject of cultural appropriation. one of the central issues of cultural appropriation is that it gives the power to determine and decide on cultural objects to an actor outside the community, which weakens the self determination of the community to manage the design themselves. this year marks the end of our confirmed funding. the potential closure of no niin would be a disservice to readers, writers, and artists. your willingness to lend support ensures no niin

brother in law asks for your insights about a cousin he thinks may have an eating disorder. a friend asks you whether it's normal to be consumed by depression months after breaking up with his girlfriend. meanwhile, your best friend wonders what you think about her husband's constant hand washing. such requests are common for psychology grad students, and they can be flattering. \\\"it feels good especially when you're just starting a new profession to have your expertise recognized,\\\" says apa ethics director stephen behnke, phd, jd. but given your stage of training, don't jump in with more input than is appropriate a scenario akin to the \\\"medical student syndrome,\\\" in which fledgling doctors diagnose and treat themselves and others, says jenny cornish, phd, training director at the university of denver's graduate school of professional psychology. \\\"often, students are eager to take on a helper role by giving people advice or telling them what to do,\\\" cornish says. \\\"that's not very helpful for therapy clients, and it's not very helpful for other people, either.\\\" so, how can you respond in a way that is helpful but maintains appropriate boundaries? experts suggest that you: beware of multiple relationships. when you offer professional advice to a friend, you're stepping into a situation the apa ethics code describes as \\\"multiple relationships,\\\" in which a therapist brings his or her therapy role into relationships with family members, friends, dating partners or others (see box for more). while the code doesn't explicitly forbid such relationships, it does caution practitioners against them, behnke says. \\\"when you mix different kinds of relationships, each of which has unique challenges and complexities, it can be a recipe for difficulties,\\\" behnke explains. \\\"in the end, trying to blend your therapy role and relationships with friends and family members may place both your friendships and your psychotherapeutic work at risk.\\\" consider the potential dangers of briefly counseling a friend who reveals a painful secret, says karen twigg sagisi, who is earning her forensic psychology degree at argosy university. \\\"the person may feel great about spilling the beans at the time, but six months later when she starts feeling better, she may look at you and say, 'she knows about that; what does she think of me?'\\\" sagisi says. giving off the cuff advice may also steer someone in the wrong direction, cornish points out, and it's no substitute for real therapy, which helps people gradually face their own defenses and draw their own conclusions. be prepared. to prevent such pitfalls from occurring, have some standard responses on tap, advises pia khandekar, a psyd student at the university of denver. \\\"i usually start out by saying, 'it sounds like a hard thing you're going through,'\\\" she says. \\\"then i make the conflict explicit that i can't give psychological advice because i'm in the role of a friend, and it's difficult to be objective.\\\" sagisi says she puts troubled friends at ease by explaining that psychologists don't consider anyone to be \\\"perfect\\\" or \\\"normal.\\\" she then asks the friend to think about how the problem is affecting his or her life and sometimes suggests getting professional help to resolve the situation. refer, refer, refer. referring people to vetted practitioners is one of the best interventions you can provide, others say. \\\"when people would tell me about serious, long standing issues, i came to realize that i could either give them advice that wouldn't do much, or help them find someone they could really get into therapy with,\\\" says neal brugman, a student in the university of denver's psyd program. he emphasizes that therapy is not meant to be threatening, but supportive and collaborative: \\\"i stress the fact that therapy is a process and that therapists are people trained to listen, observe, and help people \\u2026 resolve those issues on their own terms,\\\" he says. listen up. not all of your clinical skills need lie dormant, however, says sheila woody, phd, director of clinical training at the university of british columbia. in particular, good listening skills can help people feel understood, cared about and less alone, and that they are in a place where it's safe to think more deeply about their problem, she says. likewise, it's appropriate to attend to the level of seriousness of the situation, woody says. if a friend has told you about a family member she thinks may be suicidal, for instance, convey your judgment that the person may indeed be in danger. you can then suggest that your friend discuss the situation with other family members and determine a way to get the person appropriate help, she says. a good rule of thumb in all such instances is to consider your goals vis `a vis the meeting, woody adds. \\\"if you're trying to help the person change the problem, you may be stepping over the line,\\\" she says. \\\"but if you're conveying warmth, caring and genuine interest without trying to fix the problem, then i think you're in appropriate bounds.\\\" have resources on hand. another germane tool: psychoeducation. sagisi regularly hands out web sites, phone numbers and other resources for people who might need them. these include relevant online resources from the national institutes of health and the national alliance for the mentally ill, which both have web sites that provide information on mental illness and local mental health services; and www.militaryonesource.com , a department of defense web site that provides mental health information and referral resources for military personnel and their families. \\\"i also warn people not to take pop quizzes on other web sites that 'diagnose' or identify traits of a particular mental illness,\\\" sagisi says. remind people about self care. in addition to referring people to therapy, experts suggest advising people to take interim self care measures, such as exercising, getting enough sleep or laughing to lighten their mood. (tapping your own humor is also a great tool if people ask whether you're psychoanalyzing them another common grad school phenomenon, says chris weinkauff, who is earning her developmental psychology degree at claremont graduate university in claremont, calif. when someone questions whether she has them under the microscope, \\\"my response is, 'i'm much too busy analyzing myself to worry about you!'\\\") monitor yourself. it can be tempting though inappropriate to play therapist with loved ones, brugman acknowledges. to make sure he's not assuming an improper role, he regularly checks his responses in close relationships. \\\"if i realize i'm doing all of the listening, that's a warning sign,\\\" he says. \\\"so, i'll make sure to talk about a problem i'm having or about how that same issue came up for me and how hard it was. i make sure i take a supportive role where i'm more of a friend than a therapist.\\\" get input. finally, talk to your training director or supervisor if you're having trouble navigating any of these situations that's what they're there for, cornish says. the apa ethics code, apa ethics committee and state association ethics committees are good resources as well, she says. and bear in mind that mastering these situations is just another step toward becoming a full fledged practitioner, she says. \\\"don't be discouraged by the growing pains,\\\" cornish advises. \\\"dealing with these kinds of personal issues is all part of the bigger picture of your development of a professional identity.\\\" by tori deangelis tori deangelis is a

it was there, when my parents were in town, that they introduced me to the mingus big band and to the music of joni mitchell, whose songs i fell in love with after we saw a cover singer perform. i never considered that something might kill a venue that had been so central to my youth. there is one place, though, where the standard lives on: my matchbook collection . on the front there\\u2019s a burnt orange, rothko style square lurking behind the words \\u201cjazz standard.\\u201d on the back you\\u2019ll find a graphic of a trumpet, right above the club\\u2019s address and phone number. i couldn\\u2019t recall ever picking up this matchbook, but i imagine a handful might have been displayed by the entrance or on the low tables downstairs. either way, here was proof that the club once existed. i couldn\\u2019t resurrect the jazz standard, which originally opened in 1997, but at least i had this modest memorial to its life. since my early 20s, i\\u2019ve been amassing a collection of matchbooks from places i\\u2019ve gone, many of them now shuttered as casualties of the pandemic   a restaurant in my hometown of portland, ore., where i went for wood fired pizza; the bar where i debriefed with friends and family after seeing movies; my old co working space. i became a matchbook collector, or phillumenist, when i first moved to new york city from portland 11 years ago. i briefly lived at home after college and felt stuck; new york was an opportunity to begin a new life separate from my parents. i never intended to stay for more than a couple of years: the city was fun but also chaotic, tiring and unsustainable. it was with this mind set that a former boyfriend and i spent our first year eating and drinking our way through manhattan as a way to explore everything the city had to offer. i pocketed matchbooks from every establishment that had them, gathering analog keepsakes of my early adult life. eventually, i fell in love with new york and decided to stay   but discovered that the city is protean, sometimes painfully so. frequently, i would return after a week away to find new scaffolding erected, a dress shop vacated or a diner emptied.\",\n          \"my ten supported by my ten \\u201cmaybe i can engineer it where i work with him, and then he makes me a drink and a bowl of pasta,\\u201d the \\u201cwe are lady parts\\u201d actress said. by kathryn shattuck the past three years have been good to amina, the introverted scientist in london with rock star dreams played by anjana vasan on the peacock series \\u201cwe are lady parts.\\u201d amina completed her ph.d. in microbiology. she landed a job in stem cell research. and she underwent a glow up befitting the lead guitarist of an indie punk band made up of five muslim women. farewell, shrinking violet. amina is in her \\u201cvillain era\\u201d now. \\u201cshe\\u2019s found this confidence, and it\\u2019s almost like a new pair of shoes that she\\u2019s breaking in,\\u201d vasan, 37, said in a video interview. \\u201cshe hasn\\u2019t quite found her landing yet.\\u201d the sitcom\\u2019s three year hiatus was also good for vasan   born in india, raised in singapore and now living in london   who won a olivier award in 2023 for her performance as stella in a revival of \\u201ca streetcar named desire.\\u201d \\u201cwe were determined for a show like this not to just be this anomaly, that the show with five women of color at the helm had to have another iteration   it had to go even deeper,\\u201d she said before explaining her fascination with youtube wormholes, \\u201cveep\\u201d on repeat, townes van zandt\\u2019s music and the stationery she assembles before taking on a new job. these are edited excerpts from the conversation. 1 zarina was the first time i\\u2019d seen someone\\u2019s art and gone, \\u201coh, wow, i love this.\\u201d then i realized she was of indian heritage herself. so much of her art is about borders and home and memory and place. there was something about a simple piece of art that spoke to me in a really visceral way.\\n\\n recent and archived work by kathryn shattuck for the new york times \\u201cit\\u2019s helpful in my work,\\u201d said the star of the new tv series \\u201cwatson,\\u201d \\u201cbecause it triggers thoughts, triggers memories, triggers emotions.\\u201d by kathryn shattuck the \\u201cnight court\\u201d star loves community theater and the \\u201cdistilled joy\\u201d of watching people who perform just for fun. by kathryn shattuck the \\u201cget millie black\\u201d star is a fan of reality tv in general.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The walls were painted a glossy caramel shade, and mirrors emblazoned with the brand name covered the walls.

But he loved to run.He raced against his three brothers on the farmland and then ran the mile in high school and at Miami University of Ohio.On a rainy day in Tokyo in October 1964, he won the Olympic 5,000-meter race, besting what was considered the strongest field ever assembled for that event.Schul, who died at 86 on Sunday at a nursing home in Middletown, Ohio, became the only American to win Olympic gold in the 5,000 and did it with a remarkable sprint in the final yards on a muddy cinder track.Going into the 1960s, the U.S. running program had been known mainly for its sprint champions. That changed with a pair of storied achievements in Tokyo.Billy Mills staged one of the most spectacular upsets in Olympic track history by winning the 10,000-meter run.

A state appellate court has said thatan anti-discrimination lawsuitcan move forward.The suit charges New York with maintaining a \\u201cracialized pipeline\\u201d through which gifted and talented programs and screening practices condemn many students of color to \\u201cneglected schools that deliver inferior and unacceptable outcomes.\\u201d If successful, this landmark legal challenge could remake admissions practices at selective public schools.At the same time, in Brooklyn, a public school district that covers both poor and affluent neighborhoods has shown it is possible to integrate schools \\u2014 without rancor or a mass exodus of white families \\u2014 when parents and school officials value integration as a benefit in itself.As my colleague Troy Closson explained last week,the remaking of Brooklyn\\u2019s District 15began several years ago, when parents expressed a desire to integrate middle schools that were among the most homogeneous in the city. \\u201cSelective admissions were scrapped,\\u201d Closson wrote. \\u201cEvery child got a lottery number instead. Schools adopted targets to admit certain numbers of disadvantaged children.\\u201d Middle schools set aside seats for students who were from low-income families, living in temporary housing or still learning English. Crucially, the schools fill incoming classes through a lottery, instead of using metrics like grades or attendance.As a result, the district\\u2019s middle schools, which were the second-most socioeconomically segregated, improved to rank 19th out of the city\\u2019s 32 local districts. Teachers and students now say friendships are emerging across income lines, and a more diverse set of middle schoolers began taking state algebra exams.Antonia Martinelli, a parent leader, told The Times: \\u201cWe\\u2019ve managed to debunk this \\u2018good school-bad school\\u2019 narrative. Parents understand that they\\u2019re all great schools.\\u201dIntegration is hardly a cure-all, and challenges remain. But this example shows that breaking with segregation does not have to involve bitterness and decades of delays.Frank BruniContributing Opinion WriterThe Governor\\u2019s Race You Cannot IgnorePartisan hit jobs. Left-wing smears. That\\u2019s how Mark Robinson\\u2019s aides characterize any attention to his diatribesagainst Jewish people, gay people, women. They want voters in North Carolina, where he is the Republican nominee for governor, to see him as just another conservative whose straight talk and religiousness come under predictable fire from the ambassadors of wokeness. Nothing to see here, folks, nothing but the usual disdain for MAGA might.That\\u2019s a lie as big as any in an epoch of epic fabulism. And Robinson\\u2019s fate will bean especially revealing referendumon just how much, in the America of 2024, tribalism trumps common sense and common decency and voters tune out the truth.The governor\\u2019s racepits Robinson, who\\u2019d be North Carolina\\u2019s first Black governor, against Josh Stein, the Democrat, who\\u2019d be its first Jewish one. To go by polls, it\\u2019sa dead heat. But the Stein campaign has only justbegun its advertising blitzand three weeks ago released a whopper of an ad thatspotlights Robinson\\u2019s 2019 remarkthat abortion \\u201cis about killing the child because you weren\\u2019t responsible enough to keep your skirt down.\\u201dRobinson\\u2019s rants\\u2014mocking Paul Pelosiafter he was attacked, suggesting thatMichelle Obama is a man\\u2014 arethat hateful. And they\\u2019re the very foundation of his improbable political career: He was elected lieutenant governor of North Carolina in 2020 almost solely on the basis of a single speech in opposition to sensible restrictions on firearms. His work history included nothing \\u2014 zilch \\u2014 that prepared him for political leadership. But he could shout. He could spew.He has spewed less of late. Ambition can be a gag. But his extremism remains so close to the surface that Paul Shumaker, a Republican strategist in North Carolina, wasrecently quoted in New York magazineas predicting that \\u201cDonald Trump will unendorse Mark Robinson by the time we get to Labor Day.\\u201dRobinson should, indeed, be poison in this purple state. He should be struggling, too, given Stein\\u2019s bona fides: eight years as the state\\u2019s attorney general, before which he served in the State Senate and was a top aide to John Edwards in the U.S. Senate. There\\u2019s not a whiff of extremism about him. But late last month, The Cook Political Reportchanged its assessmentof the Stein-Robinson race from leans Democratic to tossup. In any other year, I\\u2019d be shocked. In this one? I\\u2019m just terrified.Patrick HealyDeputy Opinion Editor\\u2018Are You Seeing Any New Signs Biden Can Beat Trump?\\u2019Every Monday morning on The Point, we kick off the week with a tipsheet on the latest in the presidential campaign. Here\\u2019s what we\\u2019re looking at this week:On Saturday my brother asked me a question with some urgency in his voice: \\u201cAre you seeing any new signs Biden can beat Trump?\\u201d My brother is a 63-year-old independent in Boston who says he \\u201cvotes the person, not the party,\\u201d and thinks President Biden has done about the best anyone could at bringing America back from the disastrous Covid economy. He thinks Donald Trump would be a joke if he weren\\u2019t so dangerous.I told him about some of Biden\\u2019s latest messaging and ads emphasizing that Trump is a convicted criminal and a new Fox News national poll that gives Biden a two percentage point lead over Trump and shows more voters feeling good about the economy. Then I said: \\u201cTo answer your question \\u2014 not really, no. Nothing game changing. That\\u2019s why the debate is so important.\\u201dBiden has to find ways to make people want him for another four years. Being not Trump is not enough. Biden\\u2019s biggest problem is that a small but meaningful share of his own supporters \\u2014 Biden 2020 voters, to be specific \\u2014 don\\u2019t want to vote for him again and they are considering third-party candidates, sitting out the presidential election or voting for Trump.Yes, political journalists always geek out on presidential debates and describe them as really big deals, but Thursday night\\u2019s debate is Biden\\u2019s best chance so far this year to start turning things around. He did well at his State of the Union, but it was a teleprompter speech, and I doubt many swing voters were swayed. (He didn\\u2019t get a lasting poll bounce.) Trump\\u2019s criminal conviction was good for Biden, but Biden hasn\\u2019t yet leveraged it to make voters want his decency all over again. An unscripted debate is his best shot and big test.It\\u2019s the economy, really, that\\u2019s everything. Biden has to speak plainly and with humility and feeling about what people are experiencing in the economy and how he will address inflation. He can\\u2019t tell people what to feel or lapse into defensiveness \\u2014 which is easier said than done in a debate, where the phrasing of a question or the tone or specifics of your opponent\\u2019s answer can send you off track. If Biden gets off track or has a senior moment or two, he will be judged harshly by the many voters who seem unwilling to give him credit for anything.My bet is that Biden and Trump will acquit themselves pretty well on Thursday (with Trump benefiting from his mic being muted at times, reducing the opportunity for him to sound like a raving nut again). They know the stakes, and both will be a little nervous and rusty. They will probably stick to their core messages, so it comes down to what voters want to hear the most. As my colleagueEzra Klein recently noted, Trump is talking a lot more about inflation and immigration than people may realize, and he talks about it pretty effectively. If he shows some discipline (I know, I know) and persuasively makes it sound that America was better off during his first three years in office than it is now, he could have a good night. No one knows this more than Biden; he needs to play strong offense and even stronger defense, pointing to how bad things got under Trump. The Covid economic train wreck under Trump would be one place to start.Anna MarksOpinion Staff EditorIn \\u2018House of the Dragon,\\u2019 a Sapphic Subtext Reigns SupremeHBO\\u2019s \\u201cGame of Thrones\\u201d prequel \\u201cHouse of the Dragon\\u201d has returned for a second season, bringing back the greatest tragic love story now on television: the star-crossed love of the central characters, Alicent Hightower (played by Olivia Cooke) and Rhaenyra Targaryen (played byEmma D\\u2019Arcy).The romantic energy crackling between the two queens isclear enoughto havedrawn notice. As teenage best friends, they loved each other in that heady mix of romance, friendship and mimicry characteristic of girlhood. As adults, stripped apart by forced marriages and primogeniture, their romance withers into endless competition and bitter cruelty. They plunge their families into a brutal civil war, replete with parricide and dragon fire.All the show\\u2019s conflicts could be solved if our heroines could explore more productive possibilities. Like any good tragic romance, the unfulfilled longing that stretches between the two characters acts as the tension that holds the story together. Without it, the story would feel far less Shakespearean.The story\\u2019s queer subtext is purposeful. Emily Carey, who played young Alicent Hightower in the first season of \\u201cHouse of the Dragon,\\u201d hassaidthat the two characters are \\u201cin love a little bit\\u201d and that their interactions \\u201ctoe the line between platonic and romantic.\\u201d Her counterpart, Milly Alcock, who played a young Rhaenyra Targaryen, noted the way societal circumstances keep them separate: \\u201cThese women aren\\u2019t given the privilege to know what choices they have, because of the world that they live in.\\u201dThe women of the universe of \\u201cGame of Thrones\\u201d are no strangers to sexual violence and are most often accessories to patriarchal ends. Oftentimes, the fantasy show\\u2019s violations are poorly explained away as attempts to craft a realistic mirror of historical violence. But in the case of Rhaenyra and Alicent, a \\u201crealistic\\u201d setting functions as the perfect garden in which to cultivate an allegory about the consequences ofcompulsory heterosexuality.If the queens lived in a society in which they could fully explore the feelings that hang between them, would there really be any need for a world-crushing, family-savaging civil war? Wouldn\\u2019t their world be a better place if they could just fall in love?Queer people have long trained ourselves to hunt for marginal subtext \\u2014 longing looks, brushes of hands, impotent anger \\u2014 when overt queer narratives are absent. The subtext in \\u201cHouse of the Dragon\\u201d is not marginal. Without it, the show would be yet another unremarkable installment in a franchise that has outstayed its welcome.Michelle CottleOpinion WriterBiden Is Finally Reminding Voters of Trump\\u2019s Toxic ChaosFor the first couple of weeks after Donald Trump\\u2019s felony conviction, Team Biden did not want to touch that mess \\u2014 partly out of fear of fueling Trump\\u2019s long-running claims of political persecution.That reluctance seems to have dissipated, for now at least. In recent days, the president has been going hard at Trump\\u2019s criminal status \\u2014 there\\u2019s evena new ad! \\u2014 spurred by internal polling showing that the issue could damage the MAGA king with voters. The research, an anonymous pollster toldPolitico, shows that the conviction fits with the broader message that Trump is an entitled, above-it-all, self-centered jerk who thinks accountability is for losers. (Yes, I am paraphrasing.)This feels like the sensible play for the president. Sure, with Trump, calling out bad behavior always leads to screeching about witch hunts, which risks rallying ever more Republicans around him. On the other hand, the guyisa convicted criminal. Wouldn\\u2019tnothitting him for it suggest a certain timidness, as if the Biden campaign had in some way given up or was running scared? Not a good look for a president being slammed as too weak.Also \\u2014 and I want to put this in the gentlest way possible \\u2014 there aren\\u2019t exactly a glut of promising strategies available to Team Biden to fight the thick fog of voter frustration and dissatisfaction swirling around its guy. This president has many fine qualities and has been impressively productive. But he isn\\u2019t an exciting or inspirational figure. Back in 2020, voters were craving slow and steady. Now, with Americans in a sour mood \\u2014 and with that whole Biden-seems-older-than-dirt thing prompting ever more anxiety \\u2014 his options for driving voters to the polls feel limited and heavily skewed toward the negative.This is not shaping up to be a hopey-changey sort of election.Biden\\u2019s advisers think the best way to combat a host of voter concerns is to remind people of the toxic chaos Trump brings. His conviction seems like a solid addition to the mix. Even many voters who could not care less about the particulars of the case may find themselves once again pondering the return of Trump\\u2019s relentless drama with dread and exhaustion.Jesse WegmanEditorial Board MemberThe Supreme Court Dials Down the Chaos on GunsViolent people who pose a clear and immediate threat to the physical safety of others should not be allowed to possess firearms. That seems like a statement any reasonable person living in a self-governing society can readily agree with. And yet on Friday morning, it took the United States Supreme Court103 pages of opinions, concurrences and dissent to work it all out.The good news is that eight members of the court landed on the right conclusion, agreeing thatthe Second Amendment permits lawslike the one that stripped weapons from Zackey Rahimi, a domestic abuser and general public menace who shoots guns the way regular people shake hands.The bad news is that the justices had to go to such lengths to do it \\u2014 debating the meaning of old English surety and affray laws rather than simply acknowledging that no right is absolute and that the government has always kept weapons away from people who have proved themselves to be dangerous to others.The spectacle of judges role-playing as amateur historians is embarrassing to watch, and yet the court chose to put itself in this position with its gobsmacking 2022 decision inNew York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen, which required that any gun law be \\u201cconsistent with the nation\\u2019s historical tradition of firearm regulation.\\u201dIn the vision of Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote Bruen\\u2019s majority opinion for himself and the other five right-wing justices, that meant any modern law had to have essentially an exact analogue from the 18th century in order to survive. In his dissent on Friday, Thomas argued that the founding generation had no federal laws like the one that took Rahimi\\u2019s guns away; ergo, it was unconstitutional.It appears to be dawning on Thomas\\u2019s fellow conservatives just how twisted that approach is. Bruen was \\u201cnot meant to suggest a law trapped in amber,\\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority.In concurrence, Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed out that it makes no sense to rely on history from a time before women and people of color were treated as equal citizens (or citizens at all). \\u201cHistory has a role to play\\u201d in any constitutional analysis, she wrote, but it must be \\u201ccalibrated to reveal something useful and transferable to the present day.\\u201d Thomas\\u2019s analysis is \\u201cso exacting as to be useless,\\u201d she wrote.There is no lack of competition for the worst, most indefensible decisions of the Roberts court, but the Bruen rulingis near the top. That\\u2019s not only because of the absurdity of its logic, but also the chaos of its practical application, which has confounded judges throughout the federal judiciary for two years.\\u201cLower courts are struggling,\\u201d Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote in her concurrence. \\u201cThey say there is little method to Bruen\\u2019s madness.\\u201dThey are right, and the court was right to ratchet the madness back on Friday, if only a little. A country that can\\u2019t properly deal with an epidemic of gun violence is not a country that can survive for long.Serge SchmemannEditorial Board MemberWhen Pariahs Like Putin and Kim Meet, Watch OutThe visit of Vladimir Putin to North Korea this week was choreographed as an old-timey Communist summit, with armies of flag-waving children, portraits waving from every lamp pole and building, lavish gifts and high-blown expressions of an old and eternal friendship.\\u201cComrade Kim Jong-un warmly embraced him,\\u201d went the official North Korean account of the airport greeting. \\u201cThe top leaders shared their innermost thoughts during an intimate conversation while driving to where they were staying.\\u201dHeady stuff, but as phony now as it was back in the day. In fact, despite professions of friendship for North Korea in the Soviet era, no Soviet leader ever visited Pyongyang. The only Kremlin leader ever to do so, in fact, was Putin himself back in 2000.That was a far different visit, at which Putin was trying to position himself as an indispensable interlocutor between a dangerous pariah and the world. At the conclusion, the Russian leader said he had become confident that North Korea would use rocket technology only for the peaceful exploration of the cosmos. (Fast-forward to June 2018: Then-President Donald Trump, returning from his visit with Kim,tweeted: \\u201cJust landed \\u2014 a long trip but everybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office. There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea.\\u201d)This Putin-Kim visit was pariah to pariah, as was their last get-together in eastern Russia in September. Putin is arguably now the greater pariah, looking for munitions and weapons to sustain his murderous war on Ukraine, and for a comrade in his hatred for the West. Kim, who was probably seeking technical support for his missile or nuclear programs, at least has not yet waged war against anyone but his own people. In any case, the text of the pact signed by Putin and Kim was not made public, and the line for public consumption was of mutual assistance in the event of foreign aggression.When pariahs meet and talk about mutual military assistance, there is reason to worry. Russia itself used to be openly concerned about North Korea\\u2019s nuclear and missile programs, and even joined in United Nations efforts to stop it. But Putin has now focused his country\\u2019s foreign policy solely on garnering what support he can for the brutal land grab that he has elevated into a war of survival against the West.From Pyongyang, Putin flew in his old Soviet plane to Hanoi, another ally from Communist days, where he was again greeted with official hugs and children waving flags. But here his anti-Western rhetoric was almost absent. His goal was simpler: to show that he can still be received in some places with honors, as President Biden and China\\u2019s Xi Jinping were on their visits to Vietnam last year.Vietnam historically has been heavily dependent on Russia for its armaments, but it has been steadily building bridges with the United States and the West. Putin\\u2019s message here was: Hey, I\\u2019m still around.Adam SternberghOpinion Culture EditorDonald Sutherland, Generational ChameleonDonald Sutherland, who died on Thursday at 88, had the kind of film career \\u2014 spanning six decades \\u2014 that means one generation of admirers will remember him as the star of films like \\u201cM*A*S*H\\u201d and \\u201cOrdinary People,\\u201d while a much younger generation will know him best as President Snow in the \\u201cHunger Games\\u201d franchise. Everyone should agree that he was a brilliant actor. But depending on what era of his career you\\u2019re most familiar with, you might argue over whether he\\u2019s best lionized as a character actor or a leading man.In fact, he was both, in a way that seems not possible now, because he came into his career in an era when character actorswereleading men.Sutherland always had the aura of a character actor, because of his chameleonlikeabilityto shift between roles and his resilient capacity to elevate any material. Yet he was undeniably a leading man for much of his career, the headline star in many of his films, such as \\u201cKlute\\u201d and \\u201cOrdinary People.\\u201d The films of that era demanded character actors as their leads: actors with the deft ability to portray many facets of humanity. Now, many studios want to anchor a film on the particular brand of charisma that\\u2019s already made an actor beloved.It\\u2019s a diverting parlor game to look around at a younger cohort and guess who\\u2019s best suited to inherit Sutherland\\u2019s mantle: To watch Jesse Plemons (age 36) steal scenes as both a righteous lawman in \\u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\\u201d and a dead-eyed sociopath in \\u201cCivil War\\u201d is to see another great character actor blossoming before our eyes. Austin Butler (32), who\\u2019s already been nominated for an Oscar \\u2014 which means he has one more nomination than Sutherland ever received \\u2014 arrives like the anti-Sutherland: a leading-man type determined to prove his acting bona fides by taking onidiosyncraticroles.Yet the real question might be less \\u201cWho will be the next Donald Sutherland?\\u201d than whether Hollywood today could nurture an actor to the heights Sutherland was able to achieve. It\\u2019s hard to imagine an actor like Sutherland arriving now and headlining a decade\\u2019s worth of films. We can be thankful not only for his talent but also for the fortuitous timing of his rise, which put those talents on full display.David FrenchOpinion ColumnistThou Shalt Not Post the Ten Commandments in the ClassroomThere is a certain irony in the bravado about the Ten Commandments from Gov. Jeff Landry of Louisiana. On Saturday he told attendees at a Republican fund-raiser, \\u201cI can\\u2019t wait to be sued.\\u201d Clearly, he knows that the Supreme Court previously ruled against mandatory displays of the Ten Commandments in the classroom. In a 1980 case,Stone v. Graham, the Supreme Court struck down a Kentucky law that required the posting of the Ten Commandments, purchased through private donations, in every public school classroom in the state.ALouisiana lawrequiring the display of the Ten Commandments in every public classroom in the state defies this precedent,so, yes, the state will be sued.But Landry\\u2019s comments didn\\u2019t stop with bravado. He also said something else. \\u201cIf you want to respect the rule of law,\\u201d he told the guests, \\u201cyou\\u2019ve got to start from the original lawgiver, which was Moses.\\u201d To teach respect for the rule of law, he\\u2019s defying the Supreme Court? That\\u2019s an interesting message to send to students.It\\u2019s consistent with an emerging Republican approach to constitutional law. Just as many Republicans view their constituency as composed of the \\u201creal\\u201d Americans, they tend to believe their interpretation of the Constitution represents the \\u201creal\\u201d Constitution. So we\\u2019re seeing aflurryofculture-war-motivatedstate laws, many of them aimed at the First Amendment, that confront precedent.The Dobbs decision gave some Republicans hope for radical change, but reversing Roe has not signaled open season on the court\\u2019s rulings. Republicans\\u2019challenges to the Voting Rights Act failed, theindependent state legislature theory foundered, and efforts toexpand the standing doctrine to limit access to the abortion pillfaltered. Even so, it\\u2019s premature to declare that the Supreme Court is frustrating the MAGA right.Altering constitutional law is not the only motivation here; a version of Christian mysticism is also in play. There is a real belief that the Ten Commandments have a form of spiritual power over the hearts and minds of students and that posting the displays can change their lives.I\\u2019m an evangelical Christian who believes in God and the divine inspiration of Scripture, but I do not believe that documents radiate powers of personal virtue. I happened to grow up in Kentucky and went to classes before the Ten Commandments were ordered removed, and I can testify that the displays had no impact on our lives. My classmates and I were not better people because of the faded posters on the walls.Peter CoyOpinion WriterThe Pope\\u2019s Spurious PrayerPope Francistoldentertainers at the Vatican last week that he has been saying the Prayer for Good Humor for the past 40 years. He highly recommended it, which heattributed toSt. Thomas More, a martyr of the Roman Catholic Church.The prayer is very nice, but it seems to have been written not by More but by a young Englishman \\u2014 a Protestant, as far as I can tell \\u2014 in the early 20th century.This is not a big deal. No one is harmed if the pope misattributes a prayer. It is odd, though. Surely some of the scholars surrounding the pope must know about this. Did they not tell him? If not, what does that say about the culture of the Vatican?I emailed Matteo Bruni, the director of the Holy See press office, but he did not reply. I followed up with multiple emails over several days, along with a couple of voice mail messages. Niente.The Prayer for Good Humor begins with a mild joke:Give me a good digestion, Lord,And also something to digest.It ends like this:Give me a sense of humor, Lord.Give me the power to see a joke,To get some happiness from lifeAnd pass it on to other folk.This light, pleasing language doesn\\u2019t feel as though it came from the pen of More, who was beheaded in 1535 for refusing to acknowledge King Henry VIII as the head of the Church of England. Areal More prayersounds more like this: \\u201cO glorious blessed Trinity, whose justice has damned to perpetual pain many proud rebellious angels.\\u201dAbb\\u00e9 Germain Marc\\u2019hadour, a French Catholic priest who was a leading authority on More and founded a journal about him,Moreana, included the Prayer for Good Humor in a 1972piecetitled \\u201cMost Famous of More\\u2019s Spurious Prayers.\\u201dMarc\\u2019hadour investigated a legend that the prayer appeared on a tablet at Chester Cathedral, an Anglican church, in England. The dean of the cathedral wrote back to him that there was no such tablet. He enclosed a card with the prayer and this: \\u201cThe above lines were written by Thomas Henry Basil Webb, only son of Lt. Col. Sir Henry Webb, Bt., born on Aug. 12, 1898, educated at Winchester College \\u2014 he was killed on the Somme, Dec. 1, 1917, aged 19.\\u201d According to another source I found, Webb might have written the prayer when he was just12 years old.I\\u2019m hoping Francis keeps saying the prayer, even if word gets to him that it\\u2019s no More. We all should have the power to see a joke.David FirestoneDeputy Editor, the Editorial BoardThe Profound Unseriousness of J.D. VanceSenator J.D. Vance of Ohio likes to present himself as a serious, thoughtful conservative, one who came to understand by 2021 that Donald Trump was \\u201cdeeper than I\\u2019d given him credit for\\u201d and in 2016 recognized that Trump had some \\u201creasonable\\u201d things to say and that he \\u201csubstantively was offering something very different\\u201d from conventional Republicans. OK, that\\u2019s not an easy case to make, but Vance is entitled to try to make it.But the thing is, if you want to persuade the world that Trump is secretly deep and reasonable, then you have to demonstrate in your public actions some of those same qualities yourself. And Vance is falling far short on that score.Take, for example, the issue of guns. One of the very few things Trump got right as president was toban bump stocks,the attachments to semiautomatic weapons that turn them into rapid-fire machine guns. \\u201cWe\\u2019re knocking out bump stocks,\\u201d Trump said in 2018, a year after the Las Vegas gunman used the device to kill 60 people and injure more than 400. But last week, inone of its most dangerous decisions, the Supreme Court said that ban was illegal. When Senate Democrats said they wanted to fix that problem with a bill banning bump stocks, Vance declared the bill addressed a \\u201cfake problem\\u201d and would \\u201cend up just inhibiting the rightsof law-abiding Americans.\\u201d Presumably, he thinks there\\u2019s some kind of right to own a machine gun that even Trump isn\\u2019t aware of.\\u201cThe question is: How many people would have been shot alternatively?\\u201d Vance asked, a question so callous that it should make him an outlier even on Trump\\u2019s short list of extremist running mates.Then there\\u2019s the issue of Trump\\u2019s criminal conviction. Last week,Vance said he would leada group of Republican senators pledging to block or slow down all of President Biden\\u2019s nominees for judgeships or U.S. attorney, in retaliation for Trump\\u2019s felony conviction. (Biden had nothing to do with that New York State prosecution, but the details don\\u2019t matter when you\\u2019re doing a big pander to the MAGA crowd.) The blockade will last until Election Day, Vance said, and will also extend to any other nominees who \\u201chave suggested the Trump prosecutions were reasonable.\\u201dThese kinds of blockades are among the most juvenile and petulant tantrums an elected official can throw, putting Vance right there on the lowest level of the Senate alongside Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, the author ofanother useless blockadeand naturally an eager signer of this one. That\\u2019s Vance\\u2019s real reputation in Washington, and Trump might want to think twice before choosing someone even more preposterous than he is.Frank BruniContributing Opinion WriterThe Election of Magical ThinkingThere\\u2019s a simple way to reconcile voters\\u2019 concerns about President Biden\\u2019s age with his desire to continue his work in a second term: He demotes himself to vice president. Runs as a running mate. Someone younger tops the Democratic ticket. For the next four years, he taps his experience without exhausting his energy.Likely? Ha. There\\u2019s as good a chance I\\u2019ll win a gold in gymnastics at the Paris Olympics.But that hasn\\u2019t stopped the Biden-as-veep chatter not only on byways of the internet but also inan actual poll by SurveyUSA, which asked Americans whether they\\u2019d support that scenario. A majority said yes, suggesting that they didn\\u2019t recognize its ludicrousness. A politician doesn\\u2019t trade Air Force One for Air Force Two any more than someone with a flatbed seat in first class asks for the last row of coach. And Biden already played second fiddle under President Barack Obama. He\\u2019s not itching for an encore.So let\\u2019s junk that bunk \\u2014 and with it, other fantasies that treat a profoundly serious presidential contest in deeply unserious ways.This is an election of magical thinking beyond the usual. That\\u2019s no accident. It reflects how frustrated many Americans are with the reality of two major-party candidates who don\\u2019t appeal to them. How desperate Donald Trump\\u2019s opponents are for some grand assurance of \\u2014 or secret incantation for \\u2014 his defeat. How susceptible not only to elaborate conspiracy theories but also to milder fictions Trump\\u2019s supporters can be.No, you keen-eyed MAGA sleuths, Biden\\u2019s aides didn\\u2019t schedule an early debate so that they could replace him after he flails. Nor did they engineer Hunter Biden\\u2019s conviction just tolookvirtuous.Democrats, it isnotthe case that if journalists just stop talking about Biden\\u2019s age, many Americans miraculously won\\u2019t notice it. Nor are there tea leaves auguring a revolt against Trump at the Republican convention. A respected public intellectual privately promoted that idea to me.And Michelle Obama will not \\u2014 abracadabra! \\u2014 be riding to the rescue. She has never signaled any interest in elected office and has been clear about her distaste for the muck of politics.Indulging such illusions is dangerous. Those of us who believe that Trump\\u2019s return to the White House would be ruinous must prosaically and persistently make the case for Biden\\u2019s superiority, flaws and all. We must plan, plod, slog. No sorcery will save us.Farah StockmanEditorial Board MemberBiden Courts Some Liberal Love on ImmigrationTwo weeks after President Biden abruptlycracked down on asylum seekersat the southern border \\u2014 angering some progressives \\u2014he announced a new program on Tuesdayto protect from deportation the undocumented spouses and stepchildren of American citizens.In a certain way, it is a no-brainer. The undocumented spouses of American citizens are already eligible for citizenship, but were required to leave the country to apply for a green card, a process that can take years. That\\u2019s especially true for people who slipped across the border \\u2014 rather than overstayed a visa \\u2014 since theycould be barred from re-entry for up to 10 years. Now they will be able to apply from the United States and work legally while they wait.For about half a million American families, this is a game changer. It isbeing compared to DACA, which created a special legal status for people who were brought into the United States by their parents. But it is not quite the clear case that DACA was. Kids who were brought into the country illegally by their parents committed no crime and shouldn\\u2019t have to face the sa\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\":

loafers. the walls were painted a glossy caramel shade, and mirrors emblazoned with the brand name covered the walls. outside, a baby pink cosmic bliss ice cream truck distributed samples of strawberry glaze, mrs. bieber\\u2019s signature ice cream flavor, fashioned after her signature erewhon smoothie. with her gen z bona fides and the all important aura of celebrity, mrs. bieber, 27, a model and socialite who founded rhode in 2022, is carving out a niche within the crowded, billion dollar cosmetics and skin care industry. in some ways, the pop up is an extension of previous experiments by the brand, like a touring photo booth. \\u201cwith rhode, i\\u2019m always looking for new ways to reach our customers,\\u201d mrs. bieber said in a phone interview. \\u201ci speak so much about how rhode is a whole world that we\\u2019re creating. as a brand, we\\u2019re always wanting to bring people into the world of rhode in fun and immersive ways.\\u201d mrs. bieber visited the shop the night before, when rhode hosted a preview event for friends and skin care influencers, but she decided to skip the first day. a teenage attendee named arrens osorto demonstrated the flushed look that rhode has made its calling card. he was at the back of the line, with a full face of blush. \\u201ci\\u2019m really excited to see hailey bieber and all her makeup products from rhode,\\u201d he said smiling shyly from the back of the line. \\u201ci think she\\u2019s inside!\\u201d this reporter did not have the heart to tell him that mrs. bieber was not, in fact, at the shop. your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * name* email* website save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time i comment. sinthaya \\u00a9 2025

viral trendsetter hailey bieber has sent beauty fans into an absolute tizzy after she announced a brand new product for her beauty line rhode skin   and it has nothing to do with makeup. the 27 year old is the founder and creative director of the brand, which she launched in july 2022. it offers products like the peptide lip treatments, glazing milk, peptide glazing fluid and barrier restore cream. fans went crazy when she previously launched the tinted version of her peptide lip treatments in all different shades, but this time, the wife of justin bieber has something bigger and better to share with rhode customers. bieber is breaking the internet as she expands into something that's never been done before   an iphone case complete with a special holder tailored perfectly to fit your lip gloss. earlier this month, hailey bieber posed for a series of photos, but some eagle eyed fans spotted something totally unique in the pics: a rhode phone case tailored to fit a lip gloss the cases, which are made for the iphone 14 and 15 models, seamlessly fit the brand's peptide lip treatments with a handy pocket the case comes in a light gray color and comes complete with a small pocket for the rhode peptide lip treatment to easily slip into. in early february, the model first debuted the phone cover in a photo she posted to her instagram account, as she posed for a mirror selfie where the innovative case was visible. she wore a matching white pajama short set, complete with lace accents and a pink flower and bow as she held up her phone in the mirror. in another picture from the same carousel, the who's in my bathroom? youtube host posed with the phone case again, this time in a glammed up look as she sported a fur coat, small sunglasses and large gold hoop earrings. peeking out of the phone case was her peptide lip treatment in the color espresso, which gives the lips a rich, chocolate brown tint. the photos immediately sent fans into a frenzy, as it hadn't been announced by the brand yet   and nothing about the phone case was mentioned in bieber's caption. 'the phone case?! genius,' one commenter wrote. another agreed, 'the phone case is everything. mother.' the star introduced the case on her instagram page earlier this month, wearing a glam fur coat and chic gray sunglasses bieber's brand, rhode skin, took the internet by storm just a few months ago after they introduced a tinted version of the peptide lip treatments bieber, who is married to famed singer justin bieber, launched her skincare line in july 2022 the case, seen here in bieber's hand, comes in a light gray color, with a small pocket in the front of it for the rhode peptide lip treatment to easily slip into 'the phone case is not a want, it's a need,' someone else typed. thankfully, though, just a few weeks later, rhode skin announced that the groundbreaking phone case would finally be available for purchase on february 27 at 9am pt. the brand made the announcement on its official instagram page, showing off what it would look like with all of the different tinted shades in its pocket. '1 800 rhode. meet the lip case. compatible with iphone + your favorite peptide lip tint or treatment,' the brand wrote in the caption. along with the announcement, it also released a waitlist for people to be the first to get access to the highly anticipated phone case   although it's unclear exactly just how many rhode fans are on it. however, a new launch doesn't come without a bit of controversy. in the comments section on rhode's instagram announcement, some users lamented about the fact that its only selling for the iphone 14 and 15 models. others complained that the android was left out. the model has become a viral trendsetter over the past few years, with many taking inspiration from her chrome manicures and footwear choices rhode skin announced that the groundbreaking phone case would finally be available for purchase on february 27 at 9am pt while many fans were excited for the phone case launch, others lamented that it wasn't made to fit their iphone model 'my iphone 13 & i are crying,' one user typed. another agreed, 'do yall know not all of us use iphone?? what's the point of selling them if you are gonna exclude a big part of costumers.' 'the disrespect to the iphone 13 pro max girlies,' an instagram viewer lamented. someone else wrote, 'i need this!!! i just wish you had an iphone 12 pro like i do because you guys don't sell it.' fortunately, though, rhode responded to some of the comments on the page explaining that it had an option for customers to share which size phone they owned for future restocks. since the announcement, it seems like bieber has been taking the phone case with her everywhere. last week, bieber took two more snaps of herself holding the case   one where she's dressed in an all red ensemble, and another glam mirror selfie. she also took it all the way with her to las vegas for super bowl lviii, which was shown in a cheeky teaser video posted on the skincare brand's instagram. the ralph lauren model could be seen applying a mid game touch up of her lip gloss, and then sliding it back seamlessly into the case. published by associated newspapers ltd part of the daily mail,

2024. it was last updated in january 2025. hailey bieber is the queen of food themed beauty trends on tik tok, like glazed donut skin, strawberry girl blush, and espresso makeup. she\\u2019s arguably the beauty trendsetter of this generation. her skincare brand, rhode, has become an internet sensation among gen z. at every rhode pop up, many girls seem to model hailey\\u2019s style: crop tops, oversized jeans, slicked back hair, y2k sunglasses, and rhode\\u2019s phone cases. the hailey bieber\\u2019s strawberry glaze skin smoothie was released in 2022 at the highly coveted supermarket chain, erewhon. two years later, it continues to be their best selling smoothie. everything she touches turns to gold! after the success of rhode skincare, the brand has made its foray into the makeup world by releasing the pocket blush. these cream blushes come in six shades and are designed to be thrown in your purse. i wish they had created a packaging like this with the peptide lip treatment! the packaging gets dirty very easily, especially if you carry it in your purse like i do. but i digress\\u2026 to celebrate the release of the pocket blushes, rhode did a pop up in soho, ny. some fans arrived as early as 5 am. due to the massive turnout, the brand closed the line after reaching maximum capacity. i had a positive experience with rhode\\u2019s skincare products, and i looked forward to the release of these blushes. blush is my favorite makeup product that i can\\u2019t get enough of. if i could only take three beauty products with me to a desert island, blush would be on the top of the list. the pocket blushes were released on june 20 at 10 am and sold out on the first day. i was on the website at 9:55, ready to snag my shade, sleepy girl. as someone with a medium complexion, mauve and berry colors complement my skin tone the best. sleepy girl and toasted teddy are the two darkest shades. once i added sleepy girl to my cart, the checkout process took about 5 minutes because there was a queue. yes, an online queue! fast forward to a few days later, the pocket blush promptly arrived at my doorstep. first impressions it\\u2019s very tiny! after i got the pocket blush, i read the description on the website: \\u201cdreamy, creamy, teeny.\\u201d in the pictures, the models can be seen holding the tiny blush, but i thought it was an exaggerated visual effect for the photoshoot. i didn\\u2019t take it literally. formula the pocket blushes are formulated with peptides and tamanu oil. this oil is very thick and rich in fatty acids. it\\u2019s also anti inflammatory and supports collagen production. the formula of this blush is very lightweight, but the oil makes it very greasy. application at first sight, it looks like the blushes are going to be very pigmented, but they\\u2019re not! they are very dewy, with a sheer wash of color that mutes once you blend it on your cheeks. instead of applying the product directly onto my cheeks, i rubbed it with my finger and swatched it on the back of my hand. rhode says the blushes are buildable. however, after a few tries of rubbing my finger into the product and patting it onto my skin, i was still not satisfied with the pigment. so, i applied the tube directly on my cheeks to see if it made any difference. it slightly did. this is the result after applying four layers. the pocket blushes have a satin finish. i also tried applying the blush on my lips for the trendy monochromatic look, but it looked weird. so i applied the peptide lip treatment, which i always have handy. on the website, it says that the blushes will melt into your skin and give you baby soft cheeks with a natural glow. but in the pictures, the blush looks more pigmented. that\\u2019s why i carefully looked at all the photos before selecting my shade. here\\u2019s the blush in natural light. as you can see, the color is very muted compared to the pictures on the website. overall thoughts when i got home at around 11 am, the soft flush of color was still there, but it wasn\\u2019t too noticeable. when it comes to cream/liquid blushes, the saie dew liquid blush is my number one favorite, followed by the rare beauty soft pinch liquid blush. the saie blush is very pigmented, but has a blurring effect that looks beautiful on the skin. even if you overdo it, you\\u2019ll not look clownish! my favorite shade is dreamy. i can\\u2019t tell you how many compliments i get when i wear it! the picture below was taken early in the morning of january 2 before i went to palm springs to spend the day. when i walked into a sephora at 8pm, the first thing one employee asked me was what blush i was wearing! i didn\\u2019t even reapply it because a little bit goes a long way. i\\u2019m telling you, this blush never fails to make a lasting impression! the saie blush is a water based formula that somehow dries into a dewy matte finish without feeling thick or oily at all. i don\\u2019t know how they did it. when i wore the rhode pocket blush, i could feel the oily texture on my face. i showed the sephora employee my pictures wearing the rhode pocket blush, and she said that the pigment was so subtle that it looked like the cheek & lip tint from benefit. i love blushes where the pigment pops against my skin, providing a natural and blurring effect. makeup is expensive, and i don\\u2019t want to have to apply a product multiple times to get pigment. although rhode is still not available at sephora, the employee told me that many gen z\\u2019ers come in asking for that blush because they saw it on tiktok. with this being said, it\\u2019s clear what rhode\\u2019s core audience is. it\\u2019s also important to remember that hailey is partial to soft makeup looks. she loves to diffuse her blushes to achieve a very soft and healthy flush on her cheeks. she can pull it off beautifully! i, on the other hand, like my blushes to be more noticeable. if you\\u2019re looking for a blush focused on skincare with a very natural finish, then the pocket blush might be the right choice for you. if, on the other hand, you\\u2019re used to highly pigmented blushes, i\\u2019d look into other brands. the greasy formula was also a big deterrent. i already use my oils and serums diligently at night, and i don\\u2019t want the thick texture of an oil in my makeup products. i recently watched two makeup videos: one by gymnast suni lee for allure and one by model nara smith for vogue. coincidentally, both used the pocket blush and funnily enough, they applied the same blush afterward, patrick ta\\u2019s major headlines double take cr\\u00e8me & powder blush duo! it was interesting that they felt the need to layer a more pigmented blush on top. i mean, would you use this much blush only to layer it with another one? suni about the patrick ta blush: \\u201ci literally use this every single day\\u201d. compared to the color payoff of the patrick ta blush, the pocket blushes are like a toy. after nara and sunni apply it for that subtle flush of color, they bring out the big guns, figuratively speaking. while i was writing this post, i read a review from stylecaster.com. i\\u2019m glad i\\u2019m not the only one who thought these blushes were a letdown! the author said: \\u201csince i\\u2019m so used to cloud paint (glossier), i always apply the tiniest amount because of how pigmented it is. but in terms of color payoff, the pocket blush left a lot to be desired. to me, it seems a little excessive to have to apply the blush and blend it out multiple times to get a more saturated look.\\u201d the beauty editors at marie claire magazine tried on different shades. the girl on the right is wearing piggy, but it\\u2019s barely visible. here\\u2019s tamison o\\u2019connor, elle\\u2019s uk fashion director wearing the darkest shade, toasted teddy. she said: \\u201ci\\u2019ll keep this blush at work when for when i need a little touch up before heading out for the evening   but it won\\u2019t be replacing rare beauty\\u2019s soft pinch liquid blush in my main make up bag anytime soon.\\u201d youtuber tess chung tried the six shades on her youtube channel. here\\u2019s what sleepy girl looks like on the back of her hand + blended on her cheeks. the first time i tried the pocket blush i had to apply four layers. imagine if i had to do that every time i use it! for a few more dollars, you can get a cream blush at sephora that will meet your skincare and color payoff needs: merit, patrick ta, charlotte tillbury, nars, fenty beauty, milk, westman atelier\\u2026 there are so many brands that are coming out of left field with incredible cream/liquid blush formulas! the rhode team heavily focused on skincare and not enough on pigmentation. peptide is an ingredient that is omnipresent in the rhode skincare line. why not venture into other ingredients? i only wore the blush with foundation, but given how subtle it is, i would not reach for this blush if i\\u2019m doing a full glam makeup look because it\\u2019ll disappear into thin air. had the pocket blush not been shipped all the way from the east coast, i\\u2019d have returned it. update (october 2024): after i wrote this article, i wore the pocket blush one final time. sadly, it\\u2019s been sitting in my makeup cabinet collecting dust. \\ud83d\\ude41

the final yards on a muddy track in the 1964 games in tokyo made him the only american ever to win the gold medal in that event. by richard goldstein growing up on an ohio farm, bob schul battled asthma and allergies. but he loved to run. he raced against his three brothers on the farmland and then ran the mile in high school and at miami university of ohio. on a rainy day in tokyo in october 1964, he won the olympic 5,000 meter race, besting what was considered the strongest field ever assembled for that event. schul, who died at 86 on sunday at a nursing home in middletown, ohio, became the only american to win olympic gold in the 5,000 and did it with a remarkable sprint in the final yards on a muddy cinder track. going into the 1960s, the u.s. running program had been known mainly for its sprint champions. that changed with a pair of storied achievements in tokyo. billy mills staged one of the most spectacular upsets in olympic track history by winning the 10,000 meter run. a few days later, schul got his own gold medal.\\n\\ntable of contents original layout in the beginning at tokyo there was a good deal of clatter about the new emerging forces indonesia and north korea, for example who emerged from the olympic village in a snit and went home. but when the games hit full stride last week a different kind of new emerging force emerged america's sensational distance runners. from an olympic obscurity that with two exceptions (horace ashenfelter's steeplechase gold medal in 1952 and johnny hayes's marathon victory in 1908) had extended in length to everything beyond 1,500 meters and in time through every olympic renewal since the first in athens in 1896, the u.s. moved suddenly to center stage. last sunday in a drizzling rain a tall, bony ohioan named bob schul won the 5,000 meter run, a race the u.s. had never won before (though an american was a very close second 32 years ago). schul, a 27 year old asthmatic who bundles off to california in midsummer to escape the pollen fallout in his native state, was the favorite in the race, as unlikely as that might seem when counted against america's record in the 5,000 in the past. but schul is a resolute, self assured man, one who trained under the equally imperative hungarian master, mihaly igloi, without allowing igloi to dominate him. when schul said before the race, \\\"i am the man to beat,\\\" he said it only as a man who knows precisely where he stands and more important, where he is going. schul could be the man to beat at almost any distance, he is that strong and that fast. there was a time when he appeared to be going nowhere, and he interrupted his education at miami of ohio to spend four years in the air force. but during the indoor track season last winter, under igloi's direction, he began leading where before he had followed, and in june, when he beat the new zealander bill baillie in 13:38 in a 5,000 meter run at the compton relays in california, he shattered baillie with a last quarter kick that could be felt all the way to tokyo. it was the fastest 5,000 of the year, and schul immediately became an international figure, at least in track circles. twice he ran sub four minute miles, and later he ran 8:26.4 to break michel jazy's world record in the two mile run. his strength was evident, and it was conceded that he could outkick anybody at the end of 5,000 meters except, perhaps, the frenchman jazy provided jazy had a slow enough pace to come off of. jazy reached the finals in tokyo, and so did ron clarke, the australian with the driving pace and no kick. the race began shortly after 4 in the afternoon. there were great puddles on the track, and soon anybody behind the leaders was splattered with mud to his hairline. schul was one of these, lagging back as is his custom, biding his time as clarke set a hurry up and slow down pace, sprinting and coasting and then sprinting again on the chance he would tire the others. as it turned out, he tired himself the most. jazy stayed close to clarke, running off his shoulder most of the time. the german, harald norpoth, was close, too, cursing the rain (\\\"i began losing faith as soon as i heard the rain falling in the night, because i do not run well in the rain\\\"). america's bill dellinger, the veteran who made an impressive comeback this year, ran last or next to last most of the way, which wasn't too bad since most of the field was packed in a tight little cluster. the pace discouraged nobody through the first 4,000 meters. schul ran comfortably along in the middle of the pack. when clarke sprinted, and jazy and norpoth went with him, schul let them go. then, when clarke slowed the pace, the gap that had opened slowly closed until schul was right up there with the pacesetters again. this pattern continued until, with a lap and a half to go, dellinger suddenly swept past everybody and took the lead. jazy went after him, and norpoth, clarke and schul followed. jazy later said he began his kick too soon, but he began it nevertheless. \\\"i thought,\\\" he said, \\\"that here was my chance.\\\" he moved out past dellinger. clarke, with no sprint to offer, disappeared from contention, and dellinger fell behind. jazy opened up a huge lead on norpoth and schul down the back stretch of the last lap. into the long last turn he was a good 10 yards ahead, but now there began an ominous, rolling, throaty noise from the crowd as schul launched his invincible kick. jazy looked around as he went into the home stretch \\\"i remember him looking,\\\" said schul, \\\"and i thought he must be mighty worried\\\" and his shoulders tightened. schul caught jazy halfway down the stretch, roared past him and breezed home the winner by six yards, a big grin splitting his face as he split the tape. he had run the last 300 yards in 38.4 seconds, the final quarter in 54.4. the race was slow, 13:48.8, but on this rainy track schul's time was not as important as his tactics. his sprint broke jazy, who faded to fourth place. norpoth finished second and dellinger, putting on his own sprint down the stretch, just caught jazy at the wire to finish third and win a bronze medal to add to schul's gold. schul said afterward that he would like to go for the 5,000 meter world record and \\\"maybe break the steeplechase record, too,\\\" but for the time being, \\\"i must start treating my wife like a human being again. all this has been very rough on her.\\\" four days before schul's victory, on the very first day of track and field competition, a 26 year old marine lieutenant named billy mills, seven sixteenths sioux indian and 100% unspoiled by publicity (he had never had any) won the 10,000 meter run, the first american ever to do so. unlike schul, mills an unimpressive second in the los angeles olympic trials was an almost totally unknown quantity, to americans as much as anyone else. he had never before won a major race, yet his time, 28:24.4, set a new olympic record; it was the fourth fastest 10,000 ever run; it broke the old american record set four years ago in rome by max truex by almost half a minute; and it was 45 seconds faster than mills had ever run the distance before. it was an utter and absolute surprise, and it left clarke, the prerace favorite (and the world record holder), floundering in third place and former olympic gold medal winners murray halberg and pyotr bolotnikov far, far in the ruck. two days before the race 18 year old gerry lindgren who, everyone agreed, really had no chance running against grown men but who was nonetheless everybody's secret dark horse twisted his ankle on a tree stump near the meiji shrine as he took a practice run cross country. blithely, lindgren ignored advice to pack the ankle in ice at once, and it was three hours before it was treated. by then the ankle was stiff, and whatever chance america might have had in the 10,000 seemed to have vanished. lindgren ran in the race anyway, and though he finished a creditable ninth he was never a factor. but the mysterious mills, shaking his hands at his sides as if to coax out all the tension that was building, clung to the leaders, lap after tiring lap, until he was one of only three of the 36 starters still in touch with clarke, who had set or forced the pace the entire way. four times mills seemed to drop from contention, falling as much as 15 yards behind, but each time he came on again to rejoin the leaders. five times he actually took the lead, but more often the pacesetter was clarke or the ethiopian, mamo walde, or the tunisian army sergeant, mohamed gammoudi. with 2\\u00bd laps to go, walde began to fade, and now there were three, winding their way in and out of a tangled mass of stragglers who had been lapped by the leaders. it was a terrible traffic jam and when, with one lap to go, clarke decided to make his move he found himself boxed in by mills on his right and a straggler in front. to get around he moved out and pushed against mills. at almost the same moment gammoudi, running third, had started his kick and found clarke and mills in his way. the tunisian put his hands together as if to begin a comic dive and shoved between them, getting the lead as mills broke stride and stumbled out across the track. (\\\"it was a break,\\\" he said later. \\\"out there i found harder ground, better traction, and i was able to pick up immediately.\\\") clarke, who had turned to mills as though to apologize, immediately went after gammoudi, but mills, who lost several yards recovering from the stumble, seemed out of it. at the turn into the stretch, however, he lengthened his stride and picked up speed, and as he came down the stretch, well out in the middle of the track, he suddenly loomed large on clarke's right shoulder. mills lammed past the australian, caught gammoudi 20 yards from the tape and crossed the finish line three yards ahead. mills then had to endure his first press conference. he told of being orphaned at 13, of attending high school on an indian reservation, of starting to run because he wanted to train to be a boxer (the 16 ounce gloves eventually proved too heavy), of moving to the university of kansas for an undistinguished career as a collegiate runner (\\\"i didn't get along with the coach,\\\") and finally of becoming a marine platoon leader at camp pendleton in california. his wife patsy, who was with him through the long interview, had to correct him when he reported their daughter's age as 16 months instead of 17. afterward, as billy and patsy strolled out of the stadium gate with teammate don jeisy and his wife, mrs. jeisy fashioned an imaginary banner in the sky: \\\"i can see it now billy mills day at camp pendleton.\\\" mills said, \\\"yeah. then maybe i can get some of those guys to obey orders.\\\" if obeying orders is not an american characteristic, it is a soviet one, and when nikita khrushchev finished out of the money in a private kremlin popularity poll there was consternation in russian quarters in tokyo. \\\"there is utter panic,\\\" said one russian. the word in russian is panika, and he used it again, \\\"panika\\\" and still again, \\\"panika.\\\" he paused, a man acquainted with uncertainties. \\\"it makes you have second thoughts about going back.\\\" eight of the 14 days of olympic competition had passed, and for the russians it had been eight days that must have seemed like eight five year plans fully carried out. a strong person could develop vertigo just following the spirals of their ups and downs. on the first sunday, alexy vakhonin, a bantamweight weight lifter from the ukraine, won the first gold medal of the games and acclaimed it \\\"the best present for the motherland.\\\" that afternoon propaganda booklets telling of the sweet life in russia were placed at the olympic village cafeteria entrance for american athletes to trip over. that night in the russian quarters there was cutting of pirog (russian cake) to celebrate vakhonin's victory, and the russians agreed that as the days wore on and their superiority was established they would have their pirog and eat it, too, after each new victory. on monday, a russian seaman jumped the olympic ship s.s. uritsky in yokohama harbor and begged political refuge. (at the olympic village, american shotputter parry o'brien predicted that \\\"at least three\\\" soviet athletes would do the same before the games were over, but he was merely parroting a rumor that had been whispered around the village indiscriminately since opening day.) on tuesday three russian cosmonauts who had been cast into space were reeled in again safely, right on the eve of the track and field competition. on wednesday, however, billy mills won the 10,000, which the russians consider their special cup of borsch. russian pyotr bolotnikov, winner in rome in 1960, did not even place. a russian official charged the americans half seriously with harboring a secret weapon in mills. by thursday, american swimmers were firmly enshrined as the alltime heads of the class (page 30), american track and field athletes were more than holding their own, an american divinity student, gary anderson, had won the gold medal in free rifle competition, the vesper boat club had reestablished american supremacy in eight oared rowing, and anyone at the olympics who by now could not hum the star spangled banner had to have ear trouble. in the russian barracks there was fear that the pirog might go stale, so new ground rules for celebrating were set up. \\\"the golden era is passed,\\\" said one soviet athlete, dramatically raising an imaginary glass, \\\"begins the bronze era.\\\" the cake cutting resumed. then, on thursday midnight, there went khrushchev and the next day, friday, the red chinese fired off a nuclear bomb. finally, on sunday morning, the eighth day, there began a rain that was to last until nightfall, and tokyo papers advised their readers that a little radioactive fallout from the chinese bomb test might be included with the morning edition. but in the rain (and the fallout) schul won the 5,000. after eight days, the americans had won 29 gold medals to russia's 13, and in total medals (gold, silver, bronze), led 68 to 40. russian victories were sure to come in gymnastics, boxing, greco roman wrestling, cycling, shooting and fencing, but would they now be enough? possibly. but the soviets would be hard pressed to repeat their \\\"unofficial\\\" team victories at rome and melbourne, and they definitely had lost ground in track and field. on the other hand, the americans had made up ground lost in rome by winning both sprints bob hayes at 100 meters and henry carr at 200 and, though there was international improvement and increased representation in almost every event, the americans held fast. al oerter, the two time olympic discus champion, tore muscles and cartilage in his back overextending a throw and was unable to work effectively. he talked of withdrawing (\\\"i do not like to be mediocre\\\") but then thought better of it. his first practice throw in the competition doubled him up, but he continued. to stop internal bleeding, he had frozen his side with ice packs, but the pain persisted. in the discus finals he consistently threw low for the first four of his allotted six throws and trailed ludvik danek, the world record holder from czechoslovakia. on his fifth throw, however, he came up nicely and put 61 meters (200 feet 1\\u00bd inches) between himself and the discus to win his third straight gold. later, a foreign newsman told him that danek had trained in a private camp, with his wife, for six months prior to the games. \\\"how do you get a deal like that?\\\" oerter asked. \\\"well,\\\" said the writer, \\\"you have to live in czechoslovakia.\\\" pole vaulter john pennell, the first man to clear 17 feet, reinjured his back and was unable to vault almost from the time he got to tokyo. he tried for the finals but had to quit after two jumps. he watched as teammate fred hansen, whipping into the black tokyo night after nearly 9\\u00bd hours of poke along competition, won at 16 feet 8\\u00be inches, also an olympic record. hayes jones and blaine lindgren ran one two in the 110 meter high hurdles. lindgren stumbled from the lead with less than five meters to go, on a track made slippery by the rain. jones said he was retiring as of that moment. rex cawley, forced to take mincing steps when the wind forced him close to the barrier on the backstretch, came on strong to win the 400 meter hurdles. and mike larrabee won the 400 meters over trinidad's (and yale's) favored wendell mottley. there were failures. harold connolly was disappointing in the hammer throw and peter snell obliterated the u.s. half miters. ralph boston, the 1960 gold medal winner, resumed his battle with russia's igor ter ovanesyan and beat him again, but this time england's lynn davies bested both of them with a jump of 26 feet 5\\u00bd inches. boston's last jump was his best, but as he went into the air he was struck with a wind that had pestered the jumpers all day. he came down 1\\u00bd inches short of davies' mark. \\\"good heavens,\\\" said a british newsman when he learned of davies' victory, \\\"it must have been the english weather.\\\" apart from swimming and diving, the americans did not score heavily in other sports, though there were some improvements to offset the reversals. the wrestlers won only one medal (they had three in 1960), and the weight lifters had but one bronze compared to one gold, four silvers and one bronze in 1960. but the rifle and pistol shooters won five medals and the rowing team four, and these were huge advances. in rowing america won the pairs with coxswain gold medal and then when the vesper boat club won the eight oared event regained a large measure of the prestige it lost in 1960. the u.s. had taken the eight oared gold medal in eight straight olympics before the ratzeburg rowing club of germany won in rome. the day of the finals in tokyo was blustery, and the races were postponed twice. vesper hoped its race would not be put off heavier than most other crews, vesper figured it had the power to overcome the headwind whipping across the water. when the race finally got underway the wind was still blowing, and it was almost dark. the germans and the russians got off to good starts, but just past the halfway mark vesper pulled ahead, kept widening its lead and crossed the finish line a surprising length and a half in front of the germans. karl adam, coach of the german crew, crushed by vesper's convincing win, stood on the balcony above the boathouse. \\\"i want to go home right away,\\\" he said. photo grinning bob schul breaks tape in rain soaked 5,000 meters as germany's norpoth finishes second, bill dellinger of u.s.

first american to win an olympic gold medal in the 10,000 metre race, achieving a dramatic upset victory at the 1964 olympic games in tokyo. mills, who was part sioux, grew up on an oglala sioux indian reservation and, after he was orphaned at the age of 12, attended the haskell institute, an indian school in lawrence, kansas. there and at the university of kansas, he excelled in track events but then abandoned them for two years. while serving in the u.s. marine corps, he returned to racing in 1964, qualifying for that year\\u2019s olympic games in tokyo. mills was a little known entrant in the 10,000 metre run; among those favoured to win was ron clarke, of australia, who held the world record. on a wet track, mills kept pace with the leaders until the final lap, when clarke and mohamed gammoudi of tunisia forced him to the outside of a crowded field. as clarke and gammoudi fought for the lead, mills, in a frantic final sprint, surged past them to win an electrifying victory by just three yards. his success continued in 1965, when he set an outdoor world record (27 minutes 11.6 seconds) in the six mile run and set u.s. records in the 10,000 metre and indoor three mile races. the film running brave (1984) was based on his olympic victory. in 1986 mills cofounded running strong for american indian youth, which provides health and shelter assistance while also supporting traditional cultures and languages. in 2013 mills was presented with the presidential citizens medal by u.s. pres. barack obama.\\n\\nwilliam mervin mills (born june 30, 1938), also known by his oglala lakota name tamakh\\u00f3\\u010dhe the\\u021f\\u00edla, is an american oglala lakota former track and field athlete who won a gold medal in the 10,000 metre run (6.2 mi) at the 1964 tokyo olympics. his 1964 victory is considered one of the greatest olympic upsets because he was a virtual unknown going into the event. he was the first non european to win the olympic event and remains the only winner from the americas.[3] he was also a united states marine officer. william mervin mills was born in pine ridge, south dakota, and was raised on the pine ridge indian reservation for oglala lakota people. his lakota name, tamakh\\u00f3\\u010dhe the\\u021f\\u00edla, loosely means \\\"loves his country\\\" or \\\"respects the earth.\\\"[4] he was orphaned when he was twelve years old.[5] mills took up running while attending the haskell institute, which is now known as haskell indian nations university in lawrence, kansas where he won the 1956 kshsaa class b state championship in cross country.[6] mills was both a boxer and a runner in his youth, but he gave up boxing to focus on running. he attended the university of kansas on an athletic scholarship and was a three time ncaa all america cross country runner. in 1960 he won the individual title at the big eight cross country championship. while he competed at kansas, the track team won the 1959 and 1960 outdoor national championships. after graduating in 1962 with a degree in physical education, mills entered the united states marine corps. he was a first lieutenant in the marine corps reserve when he competed in the 1964 olympics.[3] according to some sources, mills never owned his own pair of new shoes until the night before the olympic games.[7][8] mills qualified for the 1964 summer olympics on the u.s. track and field team in the 10,000 metres and the marathon. the favorite in 1964 for the 10,000 m was ron clarke of australia, who held the world record. the runners expected to challenge him were defending champion pyotr bolotnikov of the soviet union, and murray halberg of new zealand, who had won the 5,000 m in 1960. mills was largely unknown as a runner. he had finished second to gerry lindgren in the u.s. olympic trials. his time in the heats was a minute slower than clarke's. clarke set the tone of the race by using a tactic of surging every other lap. halfway through the race, only four runners were still with clarke: mohammed gammoudi of tunisia, mamo wolde of ethiopia, kokichi tsuburaya of japan, and mills. tsuburaya, the local favorite, lost contact first, then wolde. with two laps to go, only two runners were still with clarke. he had run a world record time of 28:15.6, while neither gammoudi nor mills had previously run under 29 minutes. mills and clarke were running together, with gammoudi immediately behind, as they entered the final lap. they were lapping other runners, and clarke was boxed in down the backstretch. he pushed mills once, then again. then gammoudi pushed them both and surged into the lead as they rounded the final curve. clarke recovered and began chasing gammoudi while mills appeared to be too far back to be in contention. clarke failed to catch gammoudi, but mills pulled out to lane 4 and sprinted past them both. his winning time of 28:24.4 was almost 50 seconds faster than he had run before and set a new olympic record for the event. no american had before won the 10,000 m, nor has any other american come close until galen rupp took the silver in the 2012 london olympics. american television viewers were able to hear the surprise and drama as nbc expert analyst dick bank[9][10] screamed \\\"look at mills! look at mills!\\\" over the more sedate play by play announcer bud palmer, who seemed to miss what was unfolding.[11] for bringing drama to the coverage, bank was fired, as it was considered improper at the time.[12] after the race, mills talked with clarke and asked if he was straining as hard as he could on the final straight to the finish, to which clarke replied, \\\"yes\\\". mills has stated that he tried to be relaxed during his final kick to the finish line and felt that helped him pass both gammoudi and clarke. both clarke and mills ran the marathon after the 10,000 m event. clarke finished in 9th place, and mills finished in 14th, in 2:22:55.4, approximately two and a half minutes behind clarke, six and a half minutes behind bronze medalist tsuburaya and about 10 minutes behind winner abebe bikila. mills later set u.s. records for 10,000 m (28:17.6) and the three mile run, and had a 5,000 m best of 13:41.4. in 1965, he and gerry lindgren both broke the world record for the six mile run when they finished in a tie at the aau national championships, running 27:11.6.[13] mills is the co founder of the nonprofit running strong for american indian youth with eugene krizek. the aim of running strong is to help native american people fulfill their basic needs   food, water, and shelter   while also helping their communities gain self sufficiency and self esteem. he now acts as a spokesperson for the organization and travels the country empowering native youth and encouraging them to follow their dreams.[14] mills' charity work also includes diabetes prevention and management education for adults and especially for youth. mills himself is type 2 diabetic and helps people with diabetes learn how to maintain a healthy lifestyle and improve their lives.[15] mills co wrote a book with nicholas sparks, wokini: a lakota journey to happiness and self understanding and wrote another, lessons of a lakota, made speaking tours, and sponsored some events. he lives near sacramento, california.[5] mills is the subject of the 1983 movie running brave,[1][5] in which he is portrayed by robby benson. he is also one of several athletes featured on the august 18, 2016, on being episode \\\"running as a spiritual practice\\\".[16]\\n\\nbilly mills remains the usa\\u2019s one and only gold medallist in the men\\u2019s 10,000m, a feat he achieved at tokyo 1964. the story of billy mills, the only american to this day to have won 10,000m olympic gold, is so remarkable that it is the subject of a 1983 film entitled running brave. a member of the ogala sioux tribe, mills endured a harsh upbringing in the pine ridge native american reservation in south dakota. an orphan at the age of 12, he nurtured his talent for running and boxing in his formative years and gained a place at the university of kansas, where he won a number of cross country races. graduating with a degree in physical education, he then joined the us marines as a lieutenant. it was while serving in the marines that he qualified for the 10,000m and the marathon at tokyo 1964. the favourite for the 10,000m was australia\\u2019s world record holder ron clarke, while mills, who was 26 at the time, entered the race burdened by medical concerns, having been diagnosed with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). as he later explained, he when the race got under way he was focused more on just staying in contention than actually attempting to win it. \\u201ci just tried to stay with the leaders, lap after lap after lap,\\u201d he recalled. but then came the moment that inspired the american to glory. spotting the eagle embroidered on the shirt of german runner siegfried herrmann, he cast his mind back to his childhood and kicked for home. \\u201cthe wings of an eagle!\\u201d he says. \\u201cback to my dad when i\\u2019m small: \\u2018son, you do these things, someday you\\u2019ll have wings of an eagle\\u2019. i may never be this close again. i\\u2019ve got to do it now: wings of an eagle. then i felt the tape break across my chest. a japanese man came and he said, \\u2018who are you? who are you?\\u2019 and i thought i\\u2019d miscounted the laps: \\u2018finished, finished! you are the new olympic champion\\u2019.\\u201d in a breathtaking final lap watched by a rapt 85,000 crowd and millions of tv viewers around the world, tunisia\\u2019s mohammed gammoudi broke clear of the bunch only for clarke to close the gap as the final straight approached. it was then that mills stunned everyone, bursting into the lead and taking the tape in a new olympic record time of 28.24.4, a whole 50 seconds faster than his previous personal best. a few day later mills acquitted himself admirably in the marathon, finishing 14th, around 10 minutes behind the winner, abebe bikila of ethiopia national distinction mills\\u2019 stunning triumph in tokyo has gone down in american folklore. he has since received a number of honours, among them the presidential citizens medal, which was presented to him by us president barack obama in 2012. athlete olympic results content you may

1964. 76 athletes from 49 nations entered, with three not starting in the first round. nations were limited to three athletes each, per rules in force since the 1930 olympic congress. the first two rounds were held on wednesday, 14 october, with the semifinals and final on the following day.[1] in the final, american bob hayes tied the world record of 10.0 seconds and won the gold medal.[2] enrique figuerola of cuba and harry jerome of canada tied the previous olympic record time (10.2 seconds). it was cuba's first medal in the event; canada earned its first men's 100 metres medal since 1928. this was the fifteenth time the event was held, having appeared at every olympics since the first in 1896. neither of the top two runners from 1960 returned, but rome bronze medalist brit peter radford and fourth place finisher cuban enrique figuerola did. other notable entrants were american bob hayes (the favorite who was unbeaten in the event, including the 100 yards variant, since 1962) and canadian harry jerome (a 1960 semifinalist who held a share of the world record).[3] a muscle strain prevented venezuelan horacio esteves (another 1960 semifinalist with a share of the world record) from competing.[4] cameroon, the republic of the congo, the dominican republic, iran, the ivory coast, madagascar, mali, northern rhodesia, rhodesia, senegal, and vietnam were represented in the event for the first time. the new federation of malaysia also competed for the first time, though both malaya and singapore had previously appeared. the united states was the only nation to have appeared at each of the first fifteen olympic men's 100 metres events.[citation needed] the event retained the same basic four round format from 1920 1960: heats, quarterfinals, semifinals, and a final. however, after an extremely static format from 1936 to 1956, the format was modified for a second time in 1964 after 1960's tweaks. the changes generally increased the number of athletes in each race; for the first time in olympic men's 100 metres history, 8 runners competed at a time.[3] prior to the competition, the existing world and olympic records were as follows. bob hayes had an official time of 10.0 seconds in the final, breaking the olympic record by 0.2 seconds and matching the world record. his official time of 9.9 seconds in the semifinals did not count for records purposes because of wind assistance. the top three runners in each of the 10 heats advanced. the official report describes the weather for these heats as 'rainy'. the wind varied widely, between a 2.85 m/s headwind (in heat 3) and a 1.60 m/s tailwind (in heat 6).[5] wind,  2.51 m/s the top four runners in each of the four second round heats advanced to the semifinals. the weather was cloudy and winds were tailwinds throughout.[6] wind, +1.90 m/s the top four runners in each of the two semifinals advanced to the final. the weather was described as \\\"fine,\\\" with lower humidity than the first two rounds and a temperature of 23.8 degrees celsius. there was a strong tailwind for the first semifinal and a moderate headwind for the second.[7] the tailwind speed of 5.28 m/s meant this semifinal was ineligible for record purposes. until the tokyo olympics world records were measured by officials with stopwatches, measured to the nearest tenth of a second. although fully automatic timing was used in tokyo, the times were given the appearance of manual timing. this was done by subtracting 0.05 seconds from the automatic time and rounding to the nearest tenth of a second, making hayes' time of 10.06 seconds convert to 10.0 seconds (a new olympic record and matching the existing world record), despite the fact that the officials with stopwatches had measured hayes' time to be 9.9 seconds,[8] and the average difference between manual and automatic times was typically 0.15 to 0.20 seconds. this unique method of determining the official time therefore denied hayes the record of being the first to officially record 9.9 seconds for the 100 meters. the first official times of 9.9 seconds were recorded at the \\\"night of speed\\\" in 1968. the final was run in \\\"fine\\\" weather, with a tailwind of just over a metre per second.[7] hayes ran on lane one, which had been damaged by competitors in the men's 10,000 metres and the men's 20 km walk. nevertheless, his \\\"margin of victory was described by track & field news as 'insulting to an olympic final field.'\\\"[3]\\n\\nsections about connect with us w with the evening light dying and the reflection of the

miles away in tokyo, during the 1964 olympic games. and the 26 year old billy mills was making his move. raised in poverty on an indian reservation, underestimated as an athlete since high school, withstanding alienation and racism even as a track star at the university of kansas, mills had disappeared from the camera lens on the final curve. and in keeping with the grit and surprise that defined his life to date, he was about to come from nowhere once again. suddenly, mills fills the quiet home with the rat a tat tat cadence of a sports announcer narrating the race six decades later.

(during the race, one of the broadcast announcers encapsulated that sentiment: \\u201cbilly mills of the united states is in there a man no one expects to win this particular event.\\u201d) all mills had to do was overcome history and not just the fact that an american had never won the olympic 10,000 meters. no, it was much deeper and more layered than that. he had to overcome a century of his people\\u2019s pain. in 1877, a malnourished 5 year old lakota boy traveling with his widowed mother, three brothers and sister approached men in midnight blue uniforms seated at a large wooden table on the outskirts of what is now called fort robinson, nebraska. they were surrendering. not long before, that widow sallie bush mills, the great grandmother of billy mills had pleaded with the great oglala sioux warrior crazy horse, whose face today marks the world\\u2019s largest mountain carving, in south dakota, to travel with his followers and live among the last free roaming band of lakota people. he agreed to take the woman and her children in. but as one of the fiercest and most fabled defenders of native american territory, he and his followers eventually surrendered to u.s. troops at camp robinson, where he was killed only months later. the 5 year old boy was benjamin mills, billy\\u2019s grandfather. only in recent decades, through sandy swallow, billy\\u2019s first cousin who\\u2019s worked diligently on the family\\u2019s genealogy, did billy learn of his direct link to crazy horse\\u2019s band from copies of the u.s. army\\u2019s official surrender ledger. mills holds his gold medal from the 1964 tokyo olympics. (photo by max whittaker) eleven miles northeast of where mills was born and grew up, on the pine ridge indian reservation in south dakota, was the site of the wounded knee massacre, where in 1890 the u.s. army\\u2019s 7th cavalry used rapid fire hotchkiss guns to slaughter an estimated 300 lakota men, women and children before dumping their bodies in a mass grave. the last major armed conflict between the u.s. government and the american indians, it was originally called \\u201cthe battle of wounded knee,\\u201d and the 20 medals of honor given to soldiers who participated in the slaughter are still recognized by the u.s. congress. it also holds a dark distinction: more than a century later, wounded knee, of all cruel ironies, is still the deadliest mass shooting in the nation\\u2019s history. grandpa ben, that 5 year old in 1877, never said a word about the past. no one on the pine ridge reservation did. the nuns at the boarding school and society at large wanted them to move on and assimilate. \\u201cthat was the way of life. it was just the fact of the matter, to survive,\\u201d says mills\\u2019 88 year old brother walt from his home in peoria, arizona. hewing to the indian boarding school\\u2019s warped mantra \\u201ckill the indian, save the man\\u201d they had to cut their hair, speak proper english and forget their tribal traditions. no lakota words. ever. \\u201cnone of us kids spoke lakota,\\u201d walt adds. \\u201cit was discouraged, even by your parents.\\u201d the third to last of sidney and grace allman mills\\u2019 12 children, billy lost his mother to cancer when he was 8. the defining moment of his childhood, he says, happened several months later when his father took him fishing for bullhead catfish in a creek fed by the reservation\\u2019s white clay reservoir. the sun rose over the yellowed wavy hills of scattered oak and sycamore that summer when sidney mills picked up a thin, dried, broken tree limb, roughly three feet long, still covered in moss. drawing a crude circle in the moist earth around his son, he instructed the boy to stand in the middle of the circle and close his eyes. mills, seen here as a boy on the pine ridge reservation in south dakota, grew up as part of the oglala lakota tribe. orphaned at 12, he was raised by his older sisters. (photo courtesy of the mills family) \\u201cson, you have broken wings,\\u201d he told billy, who recounts his father\\u2019s words from 1947 in vivid detail today. \\u201cyou\\u2019re feeling pain. do you feel hurt? look beyond the hurt, the hate, the self pity, the jealousy. you\\u2019ve got to look deeper, way down deep, where your dreams lie. it takes a dream to heal a broken soul. you have to find a passion, and from that comes the potential to have the wings of an eagle.\\u201d over the next three years, his father suffered several massive strokes, and mills became an orphan at 12. he slept in the same bed with walt in a small clapboard tenement, built beside a dirt road, that housed his other siblings. they had no electricity, no running water (save for a single water pump) and no indoor plumbing. the bathroom was an outhouse adjacent to their home. he was raised by two of his sisters, 18 year old margie and 16 year old ramona. no one in the household knew the term \\u201cgenerational poverty.\\u201d they only knew bologna sandwiches tasted heavenly and they had enough to eat and live on, largely unaware of the hand most native american children had been dealt. pursuing an athletic instinct, mills tried boxing, his father\\u2019s chosen sport, for a while. but after his skull was thumped repeatedly by bigger boys on the reservation, he \\u201cretired\\u201d at 0 6. he was 5 foot 2 and 104 pounds when he left home and entered his freshman year of high school at the prestigious haskell institute, serving native american youths in lawrence, kansas. he tried out for every sport at haskell and found he was decent at exactly one: running. he didn\\u2019t make the track team as a freshman, but he quickly found that the benefits of the sport transcended intramural competition. \\u201crunning was spiritual to me,\\u201d mills says. \\u201crunning helped me understand that there is no end when we die, there is a transfer, there\\u2019s a passage to the spiritual world. my dad would say we come from mother earth. and when we die, we go to mother earth. dust to dust. but spiritually, we live on forever.\\u201d he took further inspiration from an article his father read to him before he died about \\u201colympians being chosen by the gods.\\u201d young billy\\u2019s adolescent reasoning went like this: \\u201cif i became an olympian, and i was chosen by the gods, maybe i could see my mom again.\\u201d by his sophomore year at haskell, everything changed for the budding track star. he won just the third cross country race he ran that season. for the rest of high school, as he grew to 5 foot 10 and his gangly arms and corn silk thin legs now became the pistons of a churning machine, mills posted nationally ranked times and never lost a cross country race again. the university of kansas, with its premier track and field program that developed two time indoor mile world record setter wes santee, offered him a full ride athletic scholarship. away from classmates and families who looked like him for the first time, he would hear racial slurs at meets and face such indignities as a fellow student at a ku party shoving a set of bongos in his face, saying, \\u201chey, we\\u2019ve got an indian guy here. you play these!\\u201d but what mills recalled most about being a jayhawk was the overwhelming acceptance his running exploits afforded him. he wasn\\u2019t just the \\u201cinjun kid\\u201d anymore. he was an all american distance runner. he had carved out a post pine ridge identity for himself. no one or nothing could take that away. until his junior year. nov. 24, 1960, to be precise the day mills claims as the demarcation line in his life and career. that morning, at the amateur athletic union championships in louisville, kentucky, he had completed the 10,000 meter race in a personal best of 31 minutes and 58 seconds. just four competitors finished ahead of him in a field of over 100 of the world\\u2019s top amateur runners. moments later, mills was standing with a handful of fellow athletes when a photographer asked them to line up for a photo. if athletics had indeed emerged as america\\u2019s great desegregation tool, mills thought, then it was at this time, on that track, that he belonged. but then the middle aged white photographer stopped looking through his lens and fixed his gaze directly on mills. \\u201ccan that one step out? the darker skinned one, can you step out?\\u201d he blurted. mills looked blankly at him for several seconds, frozen by the man\\u2019s words. the photographer repeated, more forcefully, \\u201cplease, get out.\\u201d mills walked away dejectedly. \\u201cthe racism broke me,\\u201d he recalls. when he returned to his fourth floor hotel room in louisville, he looked down at the asphalt below his window and decided, right then, he would jump. he pulled the hotel chair away from the desk, pushed it against the metal pane and opened the glass. he looked out once more from his window, now feeling the crisp cold of the afternoon air. \\u201ci just wanted to go where it would be quiet,\\u201d he remembers. in that moment, he could make the pain go away. he climbed atop the chair, his right hand on the glass, his torso now inches over the railing as he slowly leaned forward. just one step and it would all be mercifully over. \\u201cdon\\u2019t!\\u201d a jarring physical sensation he had never known, an incessant tingling, came over his entire body. he tilted his head away from the window and looked toward his room. \\u201cdon\\u2019t!\\u201d his father had been dead for more than 10 years, but he knew that voice his baritone cadence echoing from the spirit world, urging his son not to take his own life. it had to be. mills stepped down from the chair and pushed it back behind the desk. he breathed heavily for at least a minute before picking up a pencil and opening a journal he often carried with him. moments later, he had inscribed a purpose: \\u201cgold medal. 10,000 meter run. believe. believe. believe,\\u201d the note read. mills would learn almost a year later how a perfect mental and physical storm had brought him to that window ledge. he was diagnosed with hypoglycemia, which can bring on an undetected form of depression when his blood sugar is low. paired with the soul siphoning rejection he felt after the meet, his condition turbo charged his suicidal ideation. \\u201ci came sooo close,\\u201d he says. \\u201ci just wanted to go where it was quiet. i just didn\\u2019t want to deal with that anymore.\\u201d and then the voice. \\u201cenergy. movement. \\u2018don\\u2019t.\\u2019 that was my dad\\u2019s voice. i felt it.\\u201d mills, pictured around 1955, found his footing as a high school track star at the haskell institute in kansas. \\u201crunning was spiritual to me,\\u201d he says. (photo courtesy of the mills family) within a month, during winter break, mills called the campus switchboard hoping to find a fellow ku undergrad to go out with him. rifling through dorm rooms whose landlines went unanswered because most coeds had left for christmas, the switchboard operator finally said, \\u201cyou\\u2019re really having a tough time tonight, aren\\u2019t ya?\\u201d \\u201cwell,\\u201d he replied, \\u201chow about you?\\u201d and he asked her out. after her shift ended, patricia harris, a junior art student from coffeyville, kansas, met the man on the other end of the phone for a blind date. a little over a year later, as ku seniors in january 1962, they were married. when billy needed an extra semester to graduate, pat quit school and began working to support both of them. her own dreams of becoming an artist were put on hold. every sacrifice became about furthering her husband\\u2019s running career. he had let her in on the dream. \\u201cthat\\u2019s when it became, \\u2018we,\\u2019 \\u201d billy says today. knowing he would have to register for the military draft in 1962, he applied and was accepted to the marine corps\\u2019 officer candidate school after graduation from kansas, where he\\u2019d helped the jayhawks to win two national track and field titles. before shoe companies sponsored runners and the birth of elite professional running clubs, the best of the best were recruited by military teams to run against other branches of the service. but the competition wasn\\u2019t elite enough to make anyone in the little world of track and field a believer. after qualifying for the u.s. olympic trials in the 10,000 meters, he traveled to los angeles in september 1964 to compete. (the \\u201csummer\\u201d olympics in tokyo took place in october to avoid the humidity and typhoon season of earlier months.) he had still never won a major race. his odds of being among the top three trials finishers thus qualifying for the olympics in tokyo were not great: gerry lindgren, 19 year old phenom from spokane, was the favorite in los angeles. but mills surprised everyone with a stunning second place finish 10 seconds in front of ron larrieu, the final qualifier. prior to the trials, when another athlete\\u2019s wife asked pat if she was going to tokyo, she said she didn\\u2019t know. billy hadn\\u2019t even qualified yet. however, he had a bold hunch: gambling on himself, he took out a loan from a local bank near camp pendleton, his marine corps base just north of san diego, to purchase air and hotel tickets for his young bride. when he then tried to return the money in a moment of self doubt, pat wouldn\\u2019t have it. \\u201ci didn\\u2019t know going to the games was so important to you,\\u201d he said to her. \\u201cit\\u2019s not,\\u201d she replied. \\u201ci just know you want to win. and i know you cannot win if i\\u2019m not there.\\u201d a little over a month later, on oct. 14, pat was sitting in japan national stadium in tokyo. she was armed with an 8mm camera to film the 10,000 meter race. she watched her husband step onto the track with 37 other runners still among the largest contingents in the history of the 10,000 meter olympic final. minutes before the start of the race, mills realized he hadn\\u2019t eaten enough to ensure his hypoglycemia didn\\u2019t interfere with his race. he found a track official in the locker room, who retrieved a japanese candy bar made of chocolate, nuts and caramel. among the crowded field, he lined up on the outside of the track in his no. 722 singlet. clarke, the heavily favored australian, was up front with mills\\u2019 american counterparts, lindgren and larrieu. the gun sounded. czechoslovakia\\u2019s josef tomas sprinted toward the front. the soviet squad, including defending olympic champion pyotr bolotnikov, soon moved ahead, closely followed by the americans. but lindgren, the u.s.\\u2019s best chance coming in, had suffered a sprained ankle while training in tokyo, and he and larrieu quickly dropped out of contention. by the halfway point of the 25 lap race, a pack of five runners were contending and, improbably, mills was in the lead. he held on still with just two laps remaining, battling with clarke, the upset minded mohammed gammoudi and ethiopia\\u2019s malmo wolde. then wolde fell back, and it was down to three. clarke led at the beginning of the final lap when mills made his move. even now, watching the video, it\\u2019s extraordinary to see the contact as clarke refused to let mills take the inside lane, pushing his right forearm and shoulder into the american\\u2019s torso until mills veered off course into the next lane. then gammoudi slipped through both men, picking up his stride, as he made his run for gold. mills was nowhere to be seen on the last curve, with less than 150 meters left. gammoudi was ahead of clarke by at least five meters and mills by at least 10 meters. and then it happened. as clarke and gammoudi navigated in and around lapped competitors with less than 100 meters to go, mills bolted to the outside, taking an empty lane 4, and began raising his knees and flailing his arms forward in an all out sprint. \\u201c \\u2018wings of an eagle,\\u2019 i thought, as i started sprinting,\\u201d he recalls. \\u201c \\u2018wings of an eagle.\\u2019 my father\\u2019s words had come back to me.\\u201d mills (no. 722) in his historic race in the 1964 tokyo olympics, keeping pace with heavy favorite ron clarke (pictured right of mills wearing no. 12). mills withstood hard contact from clarke in the last lap of the race, ultimately sprinting past the australian in the final stretch to cross the finish line first and notch a new olympic record for the 10,000 meters. (photo by takeo tanuma/sports illustrated via getty images) clarke was about to catch gammoudi when he saw mills fly by him. his spirit defeated in that millisecond, the world record holder inexplicably slowed his stride. mills, still in a dead sprint, catapulted past gammoudi. as nbc\\u2019s bud palmer called the final sprint, his broadcast booth sidekick dick bank who moonlighted as an adidas shoe rep at the olympics and days before had helped mills procure his first ever pair of new spikes for the race screamed an iconic call into his microphone: \\u201clook at mills! look at mills!\\u201d he won in 28 minutes, 24.4 seconds, setting a new olympic record. gammoudi held on for second in 28:24.8, with clarke third in 28:25.8. japanese emperor hirohito stood and joined the crowd in applauding wildly at national stadium. grown men were moved to tears. cordner nelson, the track & field news correspondent covering the race in tokyo, wrote that day: \\u201ca hundred and fifty pounds of fighting man went into action with an all out sprint which abruptly turned sane men into screaming hysterics. with each stride of his 5\\u2019 11\\u201d frame the marine lieutenant bore down on his rivals. [\\u2026] with a wild grin, billy mills hit the tape, arms raised in a leap of sheer joy.\\u201d amid the euphoria in the stands, the batteries on pat\\u2019s 8mm camera had run out as her husband flew by her in the final stretch. \\u201cthe next thing i saw were his hands going up in the air!\\u201d she recalls. \\u201ceveryone was going crazy! a japanese official found me and said, \\u2018the new olympic champion wants his wife!\\u2019 \\u201d gold medal in tow, the couple returned home to camp pendleton. \\u201cwe came in the back gate all by ourselves late at night,\\u201d pat says. she still remembers a sign newly posted at the base, reading: home of billy mills olympic gold medalist within weeks, thousands at memorial stadium in lawrence, kansas, unleashed a throaty roar when mills was introduced during the nebraska ku football game. coffeyville, pat\\u2019s hometown, made him its adopted son, feting him with a ticker tape parade and banquet. pine ridge, the reservation that raised him, bestowed the greatest honor: he was made a warrior by tribal elders in a naming ceremony, replete with an eagle feather headdress. tamakoce te\\u2019hila, they named him lakota for \\u201cloves his country.\\u201d his accomplishment and influence inspired runners around the country. \\u201ci had heard the news that billy mills had won the 10,000 meters,\\u201d says burfoot, the longtime runner\\u2019s world editor, thinking back to when he was a freshman at wesleyan university in connecticut. \\u201cand of course i knew that was impossible because i was actually following the sport closely. i was at a cross country practice, and i just kept explaining to these guys the significance of this victory. and i kept saying to them, \\u2018listen, if billy mills can win the goddamn olympics, i can win the boston marathon. who knows what the boundaries are? there are no boundaries. now we can go for it because he has shown us the way.\\u2019 \\u201d billy mills holds the shoes he wore when he won the gold medal in the 10,000 meter race at the 1964 tokyo olympics. (photo by max whittaker) meanwhile, the young millses had the rest of their lives to live, adapting to the long, bright afterglow of billy\\u2019s triumph. \\u201cwe were so naive,\\u201d pat recalls today. \\u201cwe were so young at the olympics. we had no idea what was going on. we just showed up, and bill won. and then we came home. we came in, unpacked our suitcases.\\u201d in 1964, elite olympic athletes had neither agents nor public relations gurus on retainer. mills knew the marines wanted to use him as a spokesman, and his commanding officer at camp pendleton insisted he be honorably discharged after doing pr instead of possibly going to vietnam with his unit. mills competed for a while after tokyo, a stretch that included setting a new u.s. record for the 10,000 meter, and a new world record in the six mile that he shared with former olympic teammate gerry lindgren both feats accomplished in 1965. once he didn\\u2019t qualify for the 1968 olympics in mexico city, however, he decided to move on from competitive racing. but after the military, everything felt overwhelming. what would they do for post career employment? could they afford to add to their young family, which already included their 3 year old daughter? \\u201cwe had no idea what we were doing,\\u201d pat says. they had another six decades of marriage ahead of them including a half century in fair oaks to figure it out. billy and pat moved to fair oaks in 1973, relocating from new mexico in part to join family friends and his sister thelma, who all lived in the area. (thelma turned 87 in march; three of billy\\u2019s 11 siblings are still alive.) mills tried to stay in shape by running on the american river parkway trail. in 1988, with a growing family, they bought some land and built a larger, two story home nearby. there, mills keeps the sacred eagle feather headdresses gifted him from various tribes and mementoes from his running career including the gold medal behind glass. pat\\u2019s abstract expressionist paintings share the space, emblems of her own accomplished artistic career. (her work also hangs in the world olympic museum in lausanne and the usa paralympic museum in colorado springs, and has appeared in galleries from reno to alberta, canada.) mills sold health and life insurance for much of the decade after he and pat arrived in the sacramento region. it paid the bills, but in the end, nothing beat being billy mills olympic gold medalist and symbol of cultural resilience and success. he first dabbled in motivational speaking as an emissary of the bureau of indian affairs, which deployed him to reservations as a positive presence with a message of self determination that mirrored the organization\\u2019s goal at the time. he sought to inspire kids who, like him, had nothing growing up to believe in themselves. at a certain point, he figured he had told his story enough. pat thought there was more, though, and that her husband\\u2019s calming voice and conviction, along with the story of his life, could inspire anyone. pat tried to book him to speak to insurance agencies, but she ran into a problem: no one took the wife of billy mills seriously enough as a public relations person. so she got an idea: don\\u2019t tell anyone she was his wife, and make up her own speakers bureau. thus, the anne harris agency was created. people liked anne harris (pat used her middle name and maiden name). they trusted her, and thus began billy\\u2019s long speaking career around the country. mills receives the presidential citizens medal from president barack obama at the white house in 2013. the olympic champion was recognized in part for co founding the charity running strong for american indian youth. (photo by jacquelyn martin/ap photo) and their first secretary? nicholas sparks. in their office, pat has an original manuscript of the notebook, sparks\\u2019 first blockbuster novel, which he gifted to them. sparks dated one of their daughters for three years at bella vista high school, where he ran the 800 meter and the mile well enough to earn a track scholarship to notre dame.

four years later, his father died. now an orphan, mills attended haskell institute, a boarding school for native americans in lawrence, kansas. mills was such a strong runner at haskell that he earned a scholarship to run for the university of kansas. \\u201cto this day, i have an incredible support system in the lawrence community, in the university of kansas community, in the haskell community,\\u201d mills said, though he recalled various instances of discrimination, such as being limited to only a few blocks while attending haskell, not being able to join a fraternity or share a room with close friends who were black or white at kansas. another time, the kansas track team traveled to a meet in texas where the white athletes were supposed to stay at a hotel with a swimming pool and the black athletes had beds lined up at a nearby military barracks; the entire team decided to stay together at the military barracks. mills made all american one year at the aau championships; when they took a team photo, someone asked mills to leave the picture   only to have another athlete say to stand next to him in the photo. after graduating from kansas, mills was commissioned into u.s. marine corps officer candidate program. he had long been enamored by the marines\\u2019 dress blues. mills also knew the tokyo games were coming up in 1 \\u00bd years and that each branch of the military would be vying to see which branch could put the most athletes on the u.s. olympic team. however, during boot camp and for several months thereafter, mills did not run. in december 1962, he was commissioned as a marine corps officer and the next month started running again, averaging 35 miles a week. the next year, at camp pendleton to train for the olympic games, mills met earl \\u201ctommy\\u201d thomson, who had recently retired as the u.s. naval academy track coach and was at camp pendleton to train marines. thomson was deaf and read lips, but he and mills immediately forged a bond as thomson served as a mentor. \\u201che was the first white man i ever trusted,\\u201d mills said. mills qualified for the olympic games in the 10,000 meter run and the marathon. in tokyo, mills did not scale back on his preparation; while it was suggested that he rest during the final days before the race and limit his training to perhaps a 200 meter race out of a starting block to mimic a closing sprint, mills went for a 25 mile run just four days before the 10,000. on race day, mills had the strength and the finishing kick, coming from behind to dramatically claim gold. as billy and his wife pat celebrated, they knew right then that they needed to use this victory to help give back. (one week later, mills finished 14th in the marathon.) photo courtesy international olympic committee the movie running brave chronicled mills\\u2019 improbable victory. mills then joined nicholas sparks to co author a book, wokini: a lakota journey to happiness and self understanding. mills is a spokesperson for christian relief services and he co founded the foundation running strong for american indian youth. as part of running strong\\u2019s commitment to its community, it operates the dreamstarter program, providing ten $10,000 grants for five consecutive years to help the next generation of american indian youths make its dreams come true. president obama awarded mills the 2012 presidential citizens medal for his efforts in native american causes. \\u201cfor this country to mature into a full fledged democracy, more than ever in the united states of america we need the people of color, we need our women, people of different religions, we need everyone to come together and understand so collectively we can choreograph the horizon of the future,\\u201d mills said. \\u201cwe have to teach this to our young people. and sport has an obligation to teach its young people, because they become ambassadors.\\u201d downtown colorado springs: 200 s. sierra madre street 80903 719.497.1234 view map u.s. olympic & paralympic museum offers parking in the adjacent park union district lot for $7.50 per day. metered parking is also available on sierra madre and vermijo. olympic marks are used under license from the u.s. olympic & paralympic committee. 36 u.s.c. 220506website development supported in part by a grant from the colorado tourism office. \\u00a92024 all rights reserved |terms \\u2981 privacy accessibility tools\\n\\nour editors will review what you\\u2019ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. st. louis 1904 olympic games, athletic festival held in st. louis, missouri, that took place july 1 november 23, 1904. the st. louis games were the third occurrence of the modern olympic games. like the 1900 olympics in paris, the 1904 games took a secondary role. the games originally were scheduled for chicago, but the location was changed to st. louis when olympic organizing committee officials decided to combine the olympics with the louisiana purchase exhibition, a large fair celebrating the 100th anniversary of the u.s. acquisition of the louisiana territory. as a result, the games suffered. several events became part of an \\u201canthropological\\u201d exhibition in which american indians, pygmies, and other \\u201ctribal\\u201d peoples competed in contests such as mud fighting and pole climbing. the games were poorly attended by both spectators and athletes. the remoteness of st. louis and growing tension in europe over the russo japanese war kept away many of the world\\u2019s best athletes. of the approximately 650 competitors representing 12 countries, fewer than 100 were from outside the united states, and about half of those were from canada. even the olympic founder, pierre de coubertin, stayed away in 1904. note: medal count per olympedia.org. numbers vary across sources, ranging from 238 to 248 for the u.s. team; the international olympic committee (ioc) has not published official totals. the overall results were predictably lopsided, with americans earning more than three fourths of the 95 gold medals and more than 230 medals in all. the track and field events, held on the campus of washington university, featured ray ewry, who repeated his paris performance by winning gold medals in all three standing jump events. american athletes archie hahn, jim lightbody, and harry hillman each won three gold medals as well. thomas kiely of ireland, who paid his own fare to the games rather than compete under the british flag, won the gold medal in an early version of the decathlon. kiely and his competitors performed the 100 yard sprint, shot put, high jump, 880 yard walk, hammer throw, pole vault, 120 yard hurdles, 56 pound weight throw, long jump, and mile run, all in a single day. the swimming events took place in an artificial lake on the fairgrounds. zolt\\u00e1n halmay of hungary and charles daniels of the united states each won two gold medals in individual swimming, while emil rausch of germany won three. boxing made its olympic debut in 1904.\\n\\nthe opening ceremony was fantastic! spectacular! the reception was extremely good and clear. the pictures are very sharp all the way through, unbelievable!   letter from sayoko to thomas tomizawa on october 10, 1964 the above reviewer, my mother, was clearly biased. sayoko was a japanese native of tochigi who met a 2nd generation japanese american named thomas in tokyo in 1958, got married, and moved to the united states. thomas was in tokyo during the 1964 tokyo olympics, working for nbc news, which broadcasted the summer games to america. in another letter a week later, my mother wrote to my father, \\u201ci have seen the olympic show tonight 5~7 pm. i see your name every other day. miura san\\u2019s sister\\u2019s friends are watching the show every night. yoko san said \\u2018tomizawa san no go shujin no namae ga deruwa yo!\\u2019 (tomizawa san\\u2019s name is coming up on the credits!)\\u201d my mother, who passed away in may of this year, wrote several letters to her husband while he was working in tokyo. she wrote about the errands she ran: buying replacement light bulbs for the refrigerator at woolworths, setting a dentist\\u2019s appointment for her 5 year old, mike, picking up the daily newspaper for her husband, paying the phone bill. she worried about an ongoing school bus strike that was inconveniencing all the parents. she complained that mike\\u2019s teacher was giving too much candy to the kids. and she bemoaned the fact that her son, roy, was crying so often she couldn\\u2019t take any decent pictures to send her husband. i had turned one years old at the start of the 1964 tokyo olympics. and while i had no idea what the olympics were then, i have a pretty good idea now. (see book.) compare and contrast 1964 tokyo olympics. 2020 tokyo olympics. they could have been, should have been so similar an experience: celebrations on a global scale that brought the world together and warmed the spirit. indeed, in 2019, tokyo2020 was gearing up to be the greatest olympics ever. but alas, the covid 19 pandemic changed the course of history. the olympics of 1964 and 2020 could not have been more different. if 1964 were a song, it was \\u201cjoy to the world.\\u201d 2020 was \\u201cain\\u2019t no sunshine.\\u201d if 1964 were a film, it was \\u201crocky.\\u201d 2020 was \\u201ci, tonya.\\u201d if 1964 were a french dessert, it was a splendid millefeuille with airy, flaky layers sandwiching luscious cream and fresh strawberries. 2020 was a deflated souffl\\u00e9. dreams unfulfilled it was this time 7 years ago when i started researching the 1964 tokyo olympics. my vision was clear: write the definitive book in english on a defining moment in modern japanese history, meet amazing people, be a talking head during tokyo2020, and have total access to the games. my dream was vivid: sit in the stands with olympians i interviewed, watching the 2020 olympics and reminiscing about the 1964 olympics. much of my vision was realized. my dream was not. covid 19 was simply a hurdle too high. with over 5 million deaths globally, and unfathomable heartbreak, the pandemic made a mockery of our pre covid priorities. had the 2020 summer olympics and paralympics been scheduled for rio or paris or la, i believe the games would have been cancelled: local political will would have wilted in the tired face of surging infection and death rates. the games must go on japan was different. there were no lock downs in japan. in fact, in the months from may to june of this year, infection rates in tokyo were decreasing as athlete training was accelerating. there were great expectations that japan would live up to its reputation as a \\u201csafe pair of hands,\\u201d hands that would ensure the health, safety and fair competition for athletes from around the world. and under those tremulous conditions, the government of japan and the organizers summoned up enough political will to continue to say, \\u201cthe show must go on.\\u201d the olympics and paralympics, after a year\\u2019s postponement, did take place. the greatest compromise the organizers made with the circumstances was to ban spectators from sporting events and greatly restrict the movement of foreign athletes, coaches, officials, support staff and press   a move that furthered dampened the spirits of those anticipating the games. in the days just prior to the start of the olympic games, there were protests calling for the cancelation of the games. only one day before the olympics opening ceremony, ariake, the man made islands where much of the tokyo2020 competition would take place, was like a ghost town. but on the afternoon of friday, july 23, 2021, hours before the start of the olympics, the aerial acrobatic jet team called the blue impulse flew over the center of tokyo painting the olympic rings in the sky to the delight of growing crowds, just as they did on october 10, 1964. people began buzzing about the stadium, fighting for photo ops in front of the olympic rings, and setting up camp for the evening. they wouldn\\u2019t be allowed in the stadium. but they knew they could watch the ceremony fireworks and drone show from anywhere around the stadium. and despite the occasional shout of protest, no one was going to stop them from joining the fun. over the course of the olympics and paralympics, the news cycle in japan featured more stories about team japan and its historic olympic medal rush (58 total, 27 gold) than the number of infections in tokyo (which happened to peak at the exact same time as the olympics and paralympics). japanese women, in fact, shined more brightly than the men. it\\u2019s the journey i did not attend any tokyo2020 sporting events, despite holding a great number of tickets. but i met friends and acquaintances from overseas here and there. and thanks to my book, i appeared on cbs and nbc in the us, cbc in canada, nhk in japan, countless times on bbc radio in the uk, as well as danish and brazilian television. the highlight of these olympics for me was when i organized and hosted, on behalf of the world olympians association, a panel of athletes who competed at the 1964 tokyo summer games, walking with them down memory lane, recalling the historic enormity of that olympiad, the magical moments of competition, and the graciousness of their japanese hosts. (see video below.) when i started this journey nearly 7 years ago, i did not achieve everything i had hoped for at tokyo2020. nobody could under the circumstances. but i remind myself of this age old adage: it is not the destination. it is the journey. along this journey, i have met hundreds of athletes, coaches, olympic and paralympic committee administrators, sports marketers, journalists and academics   people who have enriched my understanding of the world, and of humanity. i am grateful to you all. it\\u2019s the 57th anniversary of the 1964 tokyo olympics. that\\u2019s right, a summer games in autumn. the xviii olympiad was held in october to avoid, presumably to avoid the heat or typhoons of august. october is certainly cooler in tokyo. but it is also wetter. in fact, october is the month tokyo has the most rainfall. and it rained a lot during the 1964 tokyo olympics. and because it rained, the cooler temperatures seemed colder. in the case of road cyclists in hachioji, it is said they could see their breath as they raced in the rain. the cinder tracks were a muddy mess. umbrellas were de rigeur. i recently purchased hard copy black and white photographs of those games. here are a few featuring people braving the rain, because a rainy day at the olympics is better than a sunny day at the office. ever since he remembered, he loved track. little wendell mottley would tag along with his dad, who was in a local athletic association in port of spain, trinidad and tobago. as he got older, he began to run in competitions sponsored by the oil companies that had refineries on that caribbean island. \\u201cthese refineries would give off a certain smell,\\u201d mottley told me. \\u201cand as i got closer, that smell would trigger adrenaline.\\u201d at the 1964 tokyo olympics, the adrenaline was pumping. mottley was all grown up, former captain of the yale track team, and representing the upstart track team of a country that established its independence only two years before. \\u201cwe were ambitious and we thought we had a chance to bring down the big boys   the usa.\\u201d as mottley waited for edwin skinner to hand him the baton for the anchor leg of the 4\\u00d7400 relay race finals, he knew he had a chance to upset the americans. by the time he got the baton, trinidad and tobago was already in second, but the jamaican, george kerr, was just inside of mottley and created a bit of havoc for mottley. \\u201ci tried to run around him, but he flailed the baton so much that i had to run very wide of him, and those extra steps in a race of that quality cost us,\\u201d mottley said. \\u201cwhen i came around in the final lap, i was tiring, and that allowed robbie brightwell of great britain to run past me, and we ended with a bronze medal.\\u201d team usa took gold. mottley won a silver medal in the 400 meter sprint as well at the 1964 tokyo olympics, but he lost his heart to japan. chrysanthemum the first time he came to japan was for the olympics. he knew very little about the country, except wwii and kamikaze pilots. and ikebana. mottley is a lover of flowers, and he enjoyed the flower arrangements he saw wherever he went. \\u201ctokyo blew my mind,\\u201d he said. \\u201cto see the chrysanthemum all laid out in their glory   what a people to be able to do this, i thought. i was also struck by japanese landscaping, particularly japanese gardens, the brushing of the sand and stone, and the spare architecture. i had read about these things as a hobbyist, but i was amazed when i saw these things in person.\\u201d observing the care that went into the gardens and the flower arrangement, as well as how organized the games were, nothing like he had seen at track meets in the us or europe, he came to this realization: \\u201cit must take a very disciplined people to do these things.\\u201d discipline as a teenager, mottley had a life changing turn of luck. running at yet another high school meet, a track coach from loughborough university in the uk said he knew another track coach at yale university in the us, and would young mottley be interested in running track there. mottley applied and was accepted into yale, and the head of track for the elis was legendary coach, bob giegengack, who ended up being the us track coach for team usa in 1964. \\u201cfor this coach from the uk, who knew another coach in the us who might be interested, to see me run in trinidad and tobago, the stars had to align for this to have happened,\\u201d mottley remarked. but after getting to yale, luck would not be enough. mottley would learn a life long lesson in the value and impact of discipline. mottley was a sprinter, but giegengack also had him run cross country, which he hated. in the winter, too cold for the boy from the tropics, he competed at indoor meets, when arenas were filled with cigarette smoke. \\u201cafter running 600 meters, it felt like someone took a pitchfork to your lungs.\\u201d then it was back to outdoor running in the spring. every day was full. \\u201cyou get up in the morning, have breakfast, and take classes because at yale there were no concessions for athletes,\\u201d he said. \\u201cthen we trained from 2 to 5:30 pm, had dinner at 6, and then studied. it was a disciplined process, a rhythm of life. all of those years of training, that was tough work for a kid coming out of the tropics. but it served me well for the rest of the life.\\u201d life goes on mottley recalled the moments just prior to the start of the finals of the individual 400 meter sprint at the tokyo olympics. the athletes were inside the bowels of the stadium, the nerves of the competitors palpable. the officials were nervous, checking to make sure the right people were there at the right time. the runners were nervous as they began to hear and feel the buzz of the crowd. \\u201cyou emerge into the sunlight, the crowd is roaring, and the nervousness climbs, and all things race through your mind,\\u201d he explained. \\u201cthen you start hammering in your starting blocks, and suddenly everything gets shut out and the focus comes back. it\\u2019s silent. you\\u2019re absolutely focused, bam, and the race is on.\\u201d after mottley wins his silver medal at the end of the race, he sees coach giegengack, who gives him a salute. \\u201cthat\\u2019s it. it\\u2019s relief that it\\u2019s all over.\\u201d mottley ended his track career a year later, going on to an amazing career in government, serving as finance minister for his country in the 1990s, and then in financial services as a senior advisor and investment banker at credit suisse. but before he left his sporting life behind, he had one more score to settle. it was august, 1966, and trinidad and tobago was competing at the 8th british empire and commonwealth games, which were being held in kingston, jamaica. mottley, with 1964 tokyo teammates kent bernard and edwin roberts, joined by lennox yearwood faced off against jamaica on their home turf in the 4x400 yard relay. mottley had an agenda. he remembered how kerr swung the baton and forced him wide in tokyo. so when mottley completed the anchor leg of the finals, team trinidad and tobago not only beat team jamaica, they set a world record, a coda to a great career in track. the closer we get to the start, the farther we grow apart. will tokyo2020 be the inclusion games, or the exclusion games? here\\u2019s an article i wrote for \\u201ctokyo updates.\\u201d she was five years old, and she watched the 1984

backwards. it\\u2019s been incredibly well organized, to the last detail.\\u201d perhaps unsurprisingly, there was one reported case of a staff person from sri lanka who tested positive for covid on may 5. according to world rowing, safety protocol kicked in, and other members of the sri lanka team were immediately tested. the competitors and related coaches and staff are all a part of an extended bubble that envelops the visitors from airport to hotel to venue to hotel to airport, a smaller scale example of the more complex bubble that will protect the 15,000 plus athletes and para athletes and support personnel this summer for tokyo2020. barry said that the visiting teams spent three hours at haneda airport, going from station to station, answering questions, getting a covid

wherever they went, they drew huge, enthusiastic crowds. it was the summer of 1964. young men and women wearing white tops with the 1964 tokyo olympic emblem, looking something akin to the japanese flag, ran through the streets, calling to the crowds that the olympics were coming to asia. this was only 19 years after a time when japanese troops carried their nation\\u2019s flag in battlefields of asia. akiko kuno was a 24 year old japanese woman working in the olympic organizing committee\\u2019s public relations department, and was selected as a member of the overseas olympic torch relay mission. this relay wended its way through okinawa and then japan, before ending at the opening ceremonies of the tokyo olympics in the national stadium. kuno, who joined the mission from india, was concerned about the reception the japanese would get in south east asia. kuno with torch runners in bangkok   with permission of akiko kuno. the young runners, in cities like yangon (then rangoon) and bangkok ran with a uniform that had the hinomaru on it. at the airport, when we parted i can\\u2019t forget what they said. they told me proudly that this was going to be asia\\u2019s first olympics. they said their hope was that japan, which lost a war but recovered, can be a model of success, so that one day their own country could one day host an olympics. \\u201cthat is the dream that this torch relay gives us,\\u201d they told me. kuno was one of the few japanese present to witness a near perfect execution of geopolitical \\u201csoft power\\u201d in a time when the phrase didn\\u2019t exist. she was part of a team of roughly 40, members of the olympic organizing committee (ooc), a jal crew of pilots, engineers and a stewardess, as well as the japanese media. they journeyed together for 40 days during the international torch relay that started in greece on august 21, and passed through turkey, lebanon, iran, pakistan, india, myanmar (then burma), thailand, malaysia, the philippines, hong kong, taiwan and okinawa. a dream job it was march, 1964 and kuno had graduated from keio university. while most of her friends got married after graduation, kuno wanted to be part of the olympics. she had good english skills, having studied at stanford university in california as well as hope college in michigan. equally important, her father was a good friend of kazushige hirasawa, a diplomat and an influential senior journalist with nhk, who helped japan land the 1959 bid for the 1964 olympics with an inspiring speech. with hirasawa\\u2019s help, kuno became a staff member of the olympic organizing committee, which was located in the akasaka rikyu palace, the residence of the crown prince before the war. she was assigned to the public relations department, which was located in the study of the crown prince. kuno had several duties. she took visiting international olympic committee (ioc) and national olympic committee officials on tours of the various venues that workers were rushing to complete in time for the games. she coordinated with the international news agencies. for nations that were sending athletes but did not have diplomatic relations with or embassies in japan, she sourced english speaking japanese men who belonged to the junior chamber international japan, people who had the time and means to assist the people from those countries. and she was asked to take care of the most senior person in the olympic movement   avery brundage, the president of the international olympic committee. kuno said she was routinely asked to take dictation and type up documents for him, not an easy task for a famous taskmaster. he said type this and that, and there were a lot of mistakes. i was so scared. i never worked as a secretary. brundage had a warm heart but he did not smile and he had a short temper. of course, when brundage flawlessly delivered his speech, in japanese, soliciting the emperor of japan to open the tokyo olympics, he thanked kuno for her support in making sure his pronunciation was well practiced. the sacred mission one day in july, 1964, her role suddenly expanded. kuno\\u2019s supervisor came up to give her an order   that she would be assigned to the overseas torch relay mission. her only thought? \\u201cyay!\\u201d the japanese mission that oversaw the operations of the international torch relay traveled together with the sacred olympic flame, their journey spanning 12 countries and about 16,000 kilometers. this meant that they had to journey by plane. they flew on a dc 6b, a prop plane called \\u201ccity of tokyo,\\u201d which was outfitted with special safety measures to carry two specially designed containers filled with kerosene and modeled on the design of a coal mine safety lamp. kuno was one of two english interpreters on the team. the first one traveled with the team from greece to india. kuno relieved her in calcutta, india and took responsibility for the second half of the international torch relay. she explained the daily plan. the next day was the process in reverse, where runners followed the same route back to the airport. according to kuno, on average, there were about 15 runners one way, and another 15 on the return, although there were also official runners who accompanied the torch bearer. all the runners were young men and women, their uniforms and the torches donated to them by the tokyo ooc. during the course of the relay, the roads were filled with spectators hoping to get a glimpse of the olympic flame. the organizers escorted the runners with cars preceding and following the torch bearer. kuno, who was always in the car behind, was particularly anxious during those times. the fuel within the torch, a mixture of red phosphorus, manganese dioxide and magnesium burned a flare like red for only 6 minutes. kuno\\u2019s mission was to make sure that the runner got to the next runner within 6 minutes. having the sacred flame fizzle out in front of thousands would have been humiliating. it wasn\\u2019t going to happen on her watch. the crowd came out onto the road. my job was open the window say in english, \\u201cget away!\\u201d and when that didn\\u2019t work, i shouted in japanese, \\u201cdoite!\\u201d that got their attention. and the flame never died out. kuno remarked that every member of the mission felt it was imperative that the flame never go out during the relay. she said that the president of the tokyo olympic organizing committee, yasukawa daigoro, took exceptional risk management measures. after the flame was ignited by the sun in a ceremony in olympia, greece, he made sure that he got a part of that flame, which he kept on his person. in those days, japanese would keep warm on cold evenings with metal mini heaters the size of a lighter called kairo, which contained a piece of heated charcoal. according to kuno, yasukawa, who did not accompany the international tour, ignited a flame for his kairo, and put it in his pocket\\u2026just in case the dc 6 city of tokyo crashed. kuno said she was saddened to see the flame go out twice in fukushima during the start of the tokyo2020 torch relay. for her, the flame represents a powerful symbol for humanity that should never go out. while working as a part of the torch relay mission, i was so occupied with my responsibility to not let the flame die out. i remember i was so moved to see all these excited people on the streets. i think they saw the flame as a symbol of eternal peace and hope. throughout the relay, i felt that asian people were united with the same hope and dream   that war will never happen again. it is time to remember olympians who participated at the tokyo olympics in 1964 and passed away in 2020. i\\u2019ve been able to

japan, i saw people who were so courteous and polite. i knew underneath there had to be this anger. i could relate to the pain. almost a sacredness of the way they contained the pain, and the respect they showed. they were like the elders i knew, who controlled their pain, and still showed respect to others. mills and his wife, pat, had plans to return to the united states a day before the end of the games and so would not be joining the usoc arranged transport to the airport. when the usoc refused to make any special arrangements for billy an amateur with little discretionary cash in his pocket he turned to his japanese hosts, who expressed surprise that the americans would not take care of a gold medal winner and one of their biggest stars. they picked up our bags, and put them in the largest, widest limousine i had ever seen, with japanese and olympic flags up front and an american flag on the back. we took off with two motorcycles escorting us to the airport. we left japan in style. the xviii olympiad was japan\\u2019s big test. and if they passed, they thought, the world would welcome them back with open arms. and they did indeed pass that test, thanks to a stunning alignment of purpose across government, corporations, educational institutions, and local neighborhoods. as azuma ry\\u016btar\\u014d, tokyo governor and member of both the ioc and tokyo olympics organizing committee, wrote in 1965: one of the intangible legacies of the tokyo olympics is that it gave japanese people the opportunity to be united for the first time since world war ii. additionally, the tokyo olympics succeeded in playing a vital role in connecting the east and west in terms of worldwide peace and sports. as a result, the world began to show greater respect for japan and its people. in commemoration of the 56th anniversary of the xviii olympiad, here is an excerpt from my book \\u201c1964: the greatest year in the history of japan   how the tokyo olympics symbolized japan\\u2019s miraculous rise from the ashes.\\u201d \\u30b9\\u30a6\\u30a7\\u30fc\\u30c7\\u30f3\\u30c1\\u30fc\\u30e0 \\u4eba\\u547d\\u6551\\u52a9\\u3078 in pursuit of a greater good, there is often sacrifice, both big and small. in a japanese culture that prioritizes the group over the individual, keeping personal preferences and needs submerged in order to cater to the perceived interests of the neighborhood, classmates, team members, or colleagues at work are calculations of emotional and social intelligence that japanese make every day. to the japanese, the sacrifices the individual must make to the group are most often seen as praiseworthy, symbolic of a powerful value in japanese society. at the 1964 olympics, there were two sailors who came in eighteenth overall in a sailing category called the flying dutchman (fd) competition. but they came in first in the hearts of the japanese. on october 14, stig lennart k\\u00e4ll and his younger brother, lars gunnar k\\u00e4ll, in their boat hayama, were sailing in the third race of seven in the fd class competition when they saw a capsized boat ahead of them, and the two crew members floating in the middle of sagami bay. making a quick decision, the k\\u00e4ll brothers steered their way toward australian sailor ian charles winter, and plucked him out of the water. they then proceeded to the capsized australian boat, diablo, to rescue the second member of that crew, john gregory dawe, and pulled him into their boat as well. in addition to the australians, six other boats failed to complete the race, which likely meant rough conditions. and yet, the swedes, with two extra passengers, still managed to finish the heat. the exploits of the swedish crew were publicized nationally in the japanese press. fans from all over the country sent a barrage of letters and gifts of appreciation to the two swedish sailors who were singled out for their sacrifice to the greater good. it was also well publicized that the captain of the japanese women\\u2019s volleyball team was making a sacrifice for the good of her volleyball team, as well as for the country. at the age of thirty one, the team captain, masae kasai, was older by about six or seven years than most of her teammates. she had intended to retire from volleyball and get married after leading her team to japan\\u2019s first world championship in a victory over the soviet union in 1962. in fact, some felt that kasai\\u2019s duty to japanese society, as a woman, was to get married and have children, not to play volleyball. kasai herself made it clear she wanted to move on and start a family. but in the end, the call for gold and glory for japan at the 1964 tokyo olympics was so strong that she decided to delay retirement, and thus surrender herself to two more years of long, punishing hours in the gym. her sacrifice was eventually rewarded, however, as she did make it to the altar in a highly publicized wedding after the games ended. another story was that of takashi ono, the legendary veteran gymnast from akita, japan, who had already garnered twelve medals (including four golds) from the 1952, 1956, and 1960 olympiads. at thirty three, ono was the oldest member of the 1964 team. ono\\u2019s strongest discipline was the horizontal bar. it was vital he did his best to give his team a chance for gold. but ono was in considerable pain due to a right shoulder injured in his preparations for the olympics. to ease the discomfort, he was injected with an anesthetic, which resulted in the loss of feeling in his entire arm. according to rio otomo, who wrote about the gymnast in her article, narratives of the body and the 1964 tokyo olympics, ono\\u2019s injury was a major narrative of the olympics, one also taken up by famed writer yukio mishima: the horizontal bar had been cruelly attacking his shoulder for some time. his shoulder then became the enemy of the perfection that ono was aiming to achieve. it was assaulting him from within, as if it had been a spy who sold his soul to the enemy camp. less known to the public were the apprehensions of ono\\u2019s wife and teammate on the women\\u2019s gymnastics team. as otomo wrote, kiyoko ono was concerned that attempting difficult maneuvers in the air with a damaged arm could result in a terrible fall, and so she whispered to her husband as he approached the bar, \\u201cplease do not die; we have children.\\u201d not only did ono survive, the grit he showed that day helped lead his team to the gold medal. \\u30e9\\u30ca\\u30c8\\u30a5\\u30f3\\u30b2\\u30fb\\u30ab\\u30eb\\u30ca\\u30ca\\u30f3\\u30c0_\\u53f2\\u4e0a\\u6700\\u5927\\u306e\\u60e8\\u6557 while so many of the 5,000 athletes who came to tokyo in 1964 did not expect to win a medal, they did not want to be humiliated either. but in one of the most memorable sports events of the tokyo olympics the men\\u2019s 10,000 meter competition a runner from sri lanka had placed himself in a most embarrassing situation. formerly a colony called british ceylon, sri lanka had existed as an independent nation for only sixteen years prior to the 1964 games, and no one from sir lanka was expected to win a medal. but if you weren\\u2019t paying attention, you might have thought that one of their runners was battling for victory in the 10k race. with 150 meters to go, the lead pack was jockeying for position in the home stretch, each passing a runner with the number #67. in fact everybody was passing #67, who had gotten lapped several times! number 67 was a slight man named ranatunga koralage jayasekara karunananda who competed in both the 5k and 10k races in tokyo. after getting lapped in the first 1,000 meters of the 10k race, he continued to fall off the pace. when the eventual winner flared wide and put on a burst of speed to win dramatically in the final meters, karuananda had a perfect view, only meters behind. but while the winner ended his race in elation, karunananda crossed the finish line knowing he was last\\u2026with four more long laps to go. he could have stopped. if he did, he would have joined the nine others who did not finish, and no one would have noticed. instead, the officer in the sri lanka army, known to friends as karu, plodded on. the spectators at first were bewildered. wasn\\u2019t the race over? why was this guy still running\\u2026and running\\u2026and running? and yet, as karunananda ran, the crowd noise went from ambivalence to encouragement. with three laps to go, the crowd began cheering the lone competitor as he made his way around the stadium track. the winner of the race wanted so much to take a victory lap around the stadium but was thwarted by a japanese official who told him to stay put. after all, the race was still on. instead of the gold medalist, here was the last place finisher bathing in the growing cheers of 70,000, who likely only minutes before learned that #67 was karunananda of sri lanka. and when karunananda rounded the last turn, he sprinted down the straightaway, crossing the finish line to a standing ovation and a thunderous cheer, as if he had just snatched his island\\u2019s first medal. it is said that karunananda told reporters at the olympic village that he was only doing what was expected of an olympian. \\u201cthe olympic spirit is not to win, but to take part. so i came here. i took part in the 10,000 meters and completed my rounds.\\u201d karu became an overnight star in japan, his desire to complete the race a symbol of the core value of perseverance so central to japan\\u2019s successful rise from the rubble. karu represented every hardworking man and woman in japan, and they loved him for that. begin

2024. it is the site of the press center for media covering the cnn debate between president joe biden and former president donald trump on thursday. (ross williams/georgia recorder) president joe biden and former president donald trump will get a crucial opportunity to reach undecided voters and set the terms for the 2024 presidential campaign at thursday night\\u2019s debate in atlanta. partisans on either side have already made up their minds about which candidate they\\u2019ll support. and with this year\\u2019s race serving as a rematch of 2020, many americans have already formed strong and possibly unchangeable opinions about the candidates. yet there is a sizable group of voters who haven\\u2019t decided who they\\u2019ll support in november, christopher stout, a professor of political science at oregon state university, said in an interview with states newsroom. \\u201con one hand, opinions about joe biden and donald trump are baked in,\\u201d stout said. \\u201con the other hand, there\\u2019s a lot of people who aren\\u2019t paying any attention to politics and this is their first time thinking about the 2024 election.\\u201d for biden, a major objective will be to show voters the 81 year old incumbent can be energetic and forceful, stout and political strategists said. trump, 78, may focus on appealing to voters in the ideological middle and wavering republicans who want a conservative candidate but are turned off by the former president\\u2019s antics. on policy, each candidate has issues they will capitalize on as strengths. trump will probably press biden on immigration and inflation, while biden undoubtedly will be eager to criticize trump on reproductive rights. the debate, sponsored by cnn, will be moderated by the network\\u2019s jake tapper and dana bash and begin at 9 p.m. eastern, with no studio audience. it is set to last for 90 minutes and will air live on cnn with simulcast available for other cable and broadcast networks. each candidate\\u2019s microphone will be muted while the other is speaking. no props are allowed but each man will be given a pen, pad and bottle of water, cnn said. trump could gain ground with moderate and independent voters by appearing steady. after winning the presidency in 2016, trump lost to biden in 2020 amid a sense that republican leaning voters were weary of his unorthodox style and tendency to create scandal. \\u201cif he\\u2019s boring and he looks like a typical politician, that\\u2019s going to be a big plus for him,\\u201d stout said. \\u201cif he looks like a typical politician and he seems more moderate, then there\\u2019s the opportunity to bring back a set of voters who were once republican who have now left the party.\\u201d at the same time, there\\u2019s likely not too much down side for trump if he does go off script, as voters have come to expect outlandish comments and behavior, republican strategist doug heye said. \\u201cdonald trump is gonna say something crazy,\\u201d heye said. \\u201cthat is all factored in and that\\u2019s not changing anybody\\u2019s mind.\\u201d heye cited recent remarks trump has made about shark attacks, electrocution from oversized batteries and taking his shirt off to reveal psychic wounds inflicted by political opponents. in a move reminiscent of his reality show past, trump has teased a possible announcement of his vice presidential pick at the debate. but even if voters expect some degree of eccentricity from trump, that will not help him win over the undecided voters who will decide the election, said rodell mollineau, a co founder and partner at the washington based strategy firm rokk solutions and a veteran of democratic campaigns. \\u201cif you\\u2019re actually trying to reach voters, i\\u2019m not sure how trump ranting and raving, talking about delusional conspiracy theories, helps him win independent voters,\\u201d mollineau said. trump will face an additional unique challenge if he tries to look like a traditional presidential candidate: his 34 felony convictions in new york last month and the three other felony prosecutions against him pending, including two related to his efforts to overturn his loss in the 2020 election that led to the jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. \\u201ci\\u2019m watching to see how he talks about or doesn\\u2019t talk about his many court dalliances and the conviction and whatever else he has hanging over his head,\\u201d mollineau said. biden faces different questions he must answer. voters have doubts about the incumbent\\u2019s ability, due in part to his age, inclination for misspeaking and a concerted effort by republicans and gop aligned media to portray biden as past his prime. \\u201ci think biden in part is going to be trying to overcome the image that trump and republicans in general have been very successful in creating,\\u201d university of georgia political science professor charles bullock said. \\u201cthey\\u2019ve been working on this now for at least five years, and that is the image of biden being too old, being not up to it physically or mentally to continue to serve as president for another four years.\\u201d biden countered that narrative   at least temporarily   with an exuberant performance at the state of the union address this year, several observers said. matching that energy will help him have a positive debate, they said. but heye noted that despite rave reviews from democrats, the president\\u2019s state of the union performance did not improve his standing in polls. \\u201cthe reaction from democrats was: game changer,\\u201d heye said. \\u201cand if we look at the polling, the game didn\\u2019t change at all.\\u201d biden would also benefit by reminding voters of his policy record, and contrasting it with trump\\u2019s, stout and mollineau said. \\u201cit will advantage him if he can talk about policy,\\u201d stout said. \\u201cpeople don\\u2019t know the things he has done and so there\\u2019s hope maybe to inform people and sway the electorate.\\u201d biden should target left leaning voters by reminding them of his achievements on climate and the environment and his administration\\u2019s efforts to create jobs, stout said. mollineau added that biden must remind voters of trump\\u2019s tumultuous time in office and biden\\u2019s achievements thus far, while balancing that message with an acknowledgment that many americans are unsatisfied. the debate, which will be broadcast from cnn\\u2019s georgia headquarters, comes much earlier in the election cycle than usual, even before the party conventions that typically symbolize the start of the general election. the

frame the race moving forward, as many voters will be tuning in to the contest for the first time. but the nearly 19 weeks remaining until election day could also mean a candidate with a weak performance has time to recover, or that a strong performance could diminish. \\u201ci do not believe anyone is going to either win or lose the election this week,\\u201d mollineau said. bullock, the

(see full republishing guidelines.) \\u00a9 oregon capital chronicle, 2025\\n\\nas we approach the june 27 debate between president biden and presumptive nominee trump, much advice has been forthcoming as to how mr. biden should proceed. written without benefit of polling data or focus groups, the below column makes suggestions based on persuasion techniques. to prevail in thursday\\u2019s debate and then in the election, joe biden must ask \\u201cwho\\u201d needs persuading about \\u201cwhat?\\u201d the \\u201cwho\\u201d is clear   those, rightly or not, disappointed in his leadership, concerned by the \\u201che\\u2019s too old\\u201d drumbeat, or disaffected from voting by single issues, be it gaza or student loan forgiveness or the economy. and the \\u201cwhat?\\u201d what\\u2019s left is the \\u201chow?\\u201d it is here that advocacy and persuasion lessons provide guidance. let\\u2019s start with mental sharpness. the shorter and more factual the answer to a question, the sharper president biden will appear; the more rambling, the more he will play into stereotypes. that means drop the \\u2018look, let me tell you\\u2026\\u2019 prefaces. to highlight mental acuity, mr. biden must answer the questions posed, rather than moving into talking points. and when trump doesn\\u2019t answer questions, mr. biden can say \\u201che didn\\u2019t answer your question; i will.\\u201d after the third or fourth time, biden should respond with \\u201cthat\\u2019s the third time he couldn\\u2019t answer your question. is he ducking it\\u2026or isn\\u2019t he sharp enough to understand.\\u201d one more essential is the \\u201cdon\\u2019t repeat yourself\\u201d rule. we get it   biden/harris are pro choice, trump/whoever are a clear and present danger to reproductive freedom and health. say it once; and if you need emphasis, highlight specific trump proposals, like arresting women who seek abortions. but the audience wants more than a broken record. succinctness wins   if you can say it in eight to twelve words, do it. \\u201cdonald trump talked infrastructure for four years; we did it in one.\\u201d then list how   \\u201cnew bridges, safer roads, cleaner water.\\u201d bring to that a new tagline. \\u201cthere he goes again\\u201d has been taken and will seem coached, artificial, and insincere. the mantra for trump\\u2019s plans can be as simple as \\u201cthat hurts america,\\u201d or its variant \\u201cthat will hurt our children\\u201d or \\u201cour air\\u201d or \\u201cthe water you need to drink.\\u201d and the flip side? \\u201cthat only helps the rich.\\u201d not one word more   except for a concrete illustration as to how. of course, offering illustrations must not be tone deaf. for instance, biden\\u2019s job numbers are great; but touting them too much ignores the financial squeeze many people feel. when there is an issue   be it immigration or israel/gaza   that takes more time to respond to, biden should say so. \\u201cthat issue isn\\u2019t a one liner. mr. trump forgets that we have an asylum law that says we must \\u2026 and remember, with republicans we had a plan to fix the system..until this man said \\u2018vote no.\\u2019 that hurt america.\\u201d calling trump a clear and present danger to democracy or our standing in the world is true but doesn\\u2019t persuade. specifics do: and the final need? humility. because there is anger over single issues, mr. biden has to acknowledge that not everyone agrees on everything he does, but the vote won\\u2019t be about that one issue   it will be about every danger and harm mr. trump poses and the alternatives we have. humility is also best deployed when discussing trump\\u2019s felony convictions. mr. biden, wait for your moment and look for the flip. if trump talks of \\u201cweaponized\\u201d justice, call him out. your son was convicted by that system, and you respected the jury. if trump\\u2019s attack is personal, biden\\u2019s response should be: \\u201cjurors are citizens. citizens found you guilty of fraud and liable for defamation and sexual assault; and in case you forget, the new york courts are not a part of the u.s. government.\\u201d and say no more. trump will lay traps, say outrageous things, and play to fear and prejudice. but persuasion tools abound   it is a matter of understanding and deploying them. thanks to professors marian braccia and elizabeth lippy for their substantive comments and improvements. commentdocument.getelementbyid(\\\"comment\\\").setattribute( \\\"id\\\",

the toughest part in trying to gauge the potential impact of the first presidential debate is figuring out which candidate needs this more. a month ago, the answer was obvious: president joe biden. his team wouldn\\u2019t have pushed to hold an earlier debate if it hadn\\u2019t come to the conclusion that it needed to do something to shake up this race before the fall. but one conviction on 34 counts later and it\\u2019s not nearly as clear now which candidate needs this debate more. why does that matter? because the less a debate matters in the moment to a candidate, the more risk averse said candidate will become in the debate itself. based on my conversations with smart folks on both sides of the aisle, both campaigns feel a quiet confidence about their standing going into the summer and this debate. that wasn\\u2019t the case with biden world just a month ago. the small but noticeable shift toward biden in various polls has given his campaign its first evidence that former president donald trump\\u2019s legal problems might be affecting his vote share. toss in the recent positive data indicating a drop in violent crime across the country, as well as this durable economy, and one can see why team biden is as optimistic about winning re election today as it has been in over a year. but even as biden has strengthened, so, too, has trump. while he has taken a very small (and potentially significant) hit in the polls post conviction, his massive fundraising haul in the last month has allowed him to level the spending playing field with biden much earlier than the campaign had expected. the windfall of cash since the conviction is nothing short of stunning. in fact, structurally, one could argue that trump is in a stronger position overall in his campaign today than he was at this time in june 2020 (he was consistently trailing biden in the polls) and in june 2016 (remember, he was struggling to get the gop to unite around him, and ted cruz was still trying to force a second ballot at the convention). so compared to the last two cycles, trump is stronger in the polls, and he has the party more unified around him and has raised more money than even he thought was possible. and there is one other factor that could be in play that potentially makes this debate less consequential than the hype for it indicates: there is another scheduled debate. in many conventional campaigns, first debates are often nicer and less contentious than later encounters. there are a few reasons for this, but the biggest is something that might not be in play here: not wanting to make a bad first impression. and perhaps even that issue is a tad in play for both biden and trump. both have stereotypes their campaigns would like to see them debunk with this first debate. biden needs to show command of the issues and reasonable vigor for someone in his early 80s. trump needs to show that he isn\\u2019t as unhinged as he can come across at his rallies and that he isn\\u2019t as focused on himself as it appears he has been since he lost the 2020 election. for both candidates, engaging in an eye gouging, expletive filled shouting match would undermine their abilities to fix either perception. of course, both camps would love nothing more than for the post debate conversation to be about the other candidate. team trump would love nothing more than for biden\\u2019s age to become the dominant conversation, while team biden would love nothing more than for trump\\u2019s erratic behavior to be the post debate focal point. i\\u2019m not totally naive here: the debate could end up devolving into an experience similar to the first biden trump faceoff if either candidate senses he is losing and desperately needs to bait the other candidate into displaying an air of perceived weakness for all to see. but for biden to bait trump, trump has to take the bait (and he might simply be that undisciplined to take it). but the risk for biden is he could look more concerned about trump and less concerned about the voters if he\\u2019s baiting him on the legal front. and trump has already seen the downside of being too mean spirited and bully ish on the debate stage against biden during the last election. so while both campaigns would love nothing more than for this debate to showcase the other candidate\\u2019s chief weaknesses, it takes a skilled debater to make that happen. and neither one of these candidates has shown that kind of nimbleness in the recent past. ironically, the best debates of biden\\u2019s professional life were all in 2007 and 2008. and while those excellent debate performances meant nothing for him in the polls, as he was regularly treated as an also ran candidate by many in the media (hillary clinton and barack obama were essentially scored separately), it did draw the attention of his future running mate and gave the obama team confidence that he could be a worthy campaign partner. obviously, the tone and tenor of this debate are in the hands of the candidates, more so than the moderators. if each candidate chooses to try to bait his opponent and try to get him to expose his worst version of himself, the debate could devolve into an affair that turns off a lot of voters and even, perhaps, make them a bit robert. f. kennedy jr. curious. but i\\u2019m betting on a slightly more subdued affair (at least subdued for trump). remember, both campaigns think they are on winning paths, and that matters in trying to figure out how desperate a candidate might be going into a debate. realistically, both candidates are in a position where they have more to lose than gain with this first debate, and because this isn\\u2019t the last scheduled debate, i\\u2019m betting on both candidates\\u2019 attempting to showcase the best versions of themselves, as the risk of being too negative and too nasty is too great this far out from the fall. but then again, it\\u2019s trump   so the chances aren\\u2019t zero that captain chaos makes an appearance. (and if you know who captain chaos is, then you most likely have the words \\u201ccannonball, cannonball, cannonball\\u201d echoing in your head. and if that\\u2019s the case, you\\u2019re welcome!) one of the more important stipulations for the biden campaign when it came to its debate negotiations was for a sponsor to be willing to \\u201ccut the mics\\u201d when a candidate goes over his allotted speaking time. given the chaos of the first debate between trump and biden in 2020, one can understand why biden, in particular, would want an enforcement mechanism like this. but as frustrated as biden clearly was on that stage with trump back in 2020, he also ended up \\u201cwinning\\u201d that first debate in the eyes of the voters because trump\\u2019s behavior was so obnoxious. i\\u2019m not sure why the biden campaign wants to help trump look more disciplined and normal to a large national tv audience. because if the biden camp gets its way and trump is forced to abide by the time limits and he decides he can\\u2019t be heard when the mics are off, then he\\u2019ll be presenting himself as a more reasonable version of himself. the biden campaign is trying to paint trump as unhinged, and yet it is insisting cnn help make sure trump doesn\\u2019t appear that way with its call to cut the mics. personally, i think one of the biggest mistakes mainstream media made in the aftermath of the jan. 6, 2021, capitol riots was to try to deplatform trump, whether it was from mainstream social media or mainstream legacy media. it sent trump to his own media ecosystem, which he has since built up into a much more powerful tool for propaganda today than anything he had four years ago. trump\\u2019s antics always wear thin over time, but if you\\u2019re wondering why so many folks have memory holed his crazy from the first term, it\\u2019s because he was rhetorically forced into exile in alternative corners of the information ecosystem. there are two ways to deal with trump: hand him more rhetorical rope or try to cancel him. canceling him hasn\\u2019t worked, so perhaps trust the public more and let it decide whether if this is what it wants. as i argued last week, i\\u2019m convinced trump\\u2019s behavior and chaotic leadership during covid sealed his fate with voters. but had he been edited or prevented from displaying his worst instincts for the largest number of eyeballs, maybe the voters wouldn\\u2019t have tuned him out. bottom line: trust the people to figure it out; don\\u2019t treat them like 5 year old children. this week on

biden, left, speaks at an event marking the 12th anniversary of the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program in the east room at the white house on june 18, 2024, in washington, d.c. republican presidential candidate former president donald trump, right, speaks at a campaign event at 180 church, saturday, june 15, 2024, in detroit. kevin dietsch/getty images; carlos osorio/ap president biden and former president donald trump will face off in the first presidential debate of the 2024 general election on thursday night in atlanta. it begins a new phase of the presidential race, less than five months out from nov. 5, election day, as the matchup remains extremely tight. biden and trump stand virtually tied, according to the latest npr/pbs news/marist poll, which echoes a months long trend of recent national surveys. the debate also breaks with campaign tradition, occurring months earlier than usual and with a new set of rules both candidates have agreed to, including no live audience. it\\u2019s also the first debate either candidate has participated in this campaign season. biden largely ran unopposed, and trump notably skipped the gop primary debates. here\\u2019s what you need to know about this first debate. the event starts at 9 p.m. et and will run for 90 minutes. it will be moderated by cnn\\u2019s jake tapper and dana bash and take place at the network\\u2019s studios in atlanta. the debate will be available on cnn and the streaming platform max, formerly known as hbo. viewers without a cable login can watch on cnn's website. you can follow npr\\u2019s live blog for updates during the debate, as well as to watch the livestream cnn is making available to outside media organizations. that stream will include cnn's commercials and branding; npr.org will carry that livestream as a public service. biden and trump are the only presidential candidates who qualified for the debate stage. independent candidate robert f. kennedy jr. failed to meet the threshold, which required candidates to poll at 15% or higher in four national surveys and appear on enough state ballots that could theoretically push them past the needed 270 electoral college votes to secure the presidency. typically, presidential debates occur in front of a live audience, often in an event space on a college or university campus, and are coordinated by the bipartisan commission on presidential debates (cpd). but not this year. both candidates have said they will not participate in the cpd's previously scheduled and announced debates, lobbying for earlier matchups. instead, biden and trump will take part in thursday\\u2019s debate on cnn and then a second in september hosted by abc news. biden and trump have agreed to the following rules: candidates will likely speak to recent respective legal dramas. the debate comes about a month after trump was found guilty of 34 criminal charges in new york, becoming the first u.s. president in history to be convicted of felony crimes. biden's son, hunter, who is not running for office, was convicted on felony gun charges in delaware in mid june and faces a second federal trial in september over failing to pay his taxes. biden will also likely address concerns over his age and ability to serve a second term. at 81, he is the oldest sitting president in u.s. history, and if elected for a second term, he would exit office at 86. while the president has had public slipups throughout his first term, trump, who is 78, has repeatedly criticized biden's mental ability, most recently speculating he should take a cognitive test. in that same speech, trump incorrectly named the doctor who conducted his own cognitive exam while president. on the issues, it's expected the candidates will discuss the state of the economy and immigration policy, as both are consistently top issues for voters in national polling. it's also possible the candidates will weigh in on international politics, given voters remain divided on whether the u.s. should be sending military aid to ukraine and israel in their respective wars. the debate may also be an opportunity for biden to address his decreasing support, when compared to 2020, among key parts of his base, notably blacks and latinos and young voters. trump is losing some ground among older voters, and the biden campaign is trying to capitalize on that. plus, the former president may still need to repair relations with nikki haley supporters who remain uncertain about backing him again. trump will likely announce his pick for vice president in the coming weeks. there will also be a vice presidential debate this summer. the date has not been finalized, but vice president harris agreed to one held on either july 23 or aug. 13. on the legal front, trump will appear for sentencing in his criminal trial on july 11, just days before the republican national convention, which begins on july 15 in milwaukee. a month later, the democratic national convention will kick off on aug. 19 in chicago. trump and biden will debate for a second time on sept. 10. copyright 2024 npr tags: elections, elections, politics, apple news,

correspondent\\n\\n\\\"somebody's going to take advantage of it,\\\" one strategist predicted. even with under five months left to go until election day, the electoral calendar is nearly devoid of marquee chances for this year's presidential race to change in a major way. there are the two party nominating conventions, with the republican confab in july likely coinciding with a vice presidential pick from donald trump. the former president also is set to be sentenced next month after being convicted of 34 felony counts in his hush money trail in new york. beyond that, there are few concrete events with the potential to move an electoral needle that has refused to budge for months beyond the margins. that's where this week's debate comes in. while operatives who spoke to abc news were torn over how much thursday's head to head matchup could alter the fundamentals of a race between a former and current president    both with virtually universal name recognition    all agreed that the debate represents one of just a few foreseeable instances for the candidates to at least try to improve their fortunes. \\\"if you're looking at the calendar for the next five months, this is one of those moments. and somebody's going to take advantage of it,\\\" said chip saltsman, a gop strategist who worked on former vice president mike pence's now suspended gop presidential bid. already, recent history has failed to budge close polling numbers by more than a few points. trump's felony convictions led to only marginal fluctuations. the felony conviction of president joe biden's son hunter on gun charges already has largely dropped out of the news cycle. the current 538 national polling average of the race shows a virtual tie, but some polls show trump with a wide advantage in key battleground states. thursday's debate    much earlier than usual in a presidential race    offers both candidates a chance to change or reinforce perceptions. \\\"i think this will be the most consequential presidential debate ever,\\\" said alex conant, a republican strategist who worked on florida republican sen. marco rubio's 2016 presidential campaign. \\\"we've also never been a situation where there's so many questions about both candidates' core abilities. is biden too old? is trump too unstable?\\\" he told abc news. \\\"these are existential questions that a lot of the people tuning in are going to be asking. and then, obviously, we've never had a debate this early in the calendar, so it is likely to set the tone for the rest of the campaign.\\\" for biden, strategists on both side of the aisle said avoiding \\\"senior moments\\\" will be crucial, given heightened focus on the president's age and mental acuity    reinforced by the republican social media and cable ecosystem. \\\"we know one of the biggest obstacles to support for president biden is concerns about his age and whether he's up for the job. and i see the debates as a real opportunity for him to demonstrate that he has what it takes to do the job of president effectively and assuage a lot of those concerns that are currently holding back a lot of democratic leaning voters from supporting him,\\\" said one source familiar with the biden camp's strategy. biden is anticipated to hammer away at what he calls trump's threat to democracy, a theme that animated their 2020 race. but democrats also hoped the debate's early timing could help the incumbent president replicate part of former president obama's 2012 playbook when he seized early opportunities to define mitt romney, his general election opponent, as an out of touch millionaire who didn't care about working class americans. biden has already attempted to do so with trump, mixing that messaging with what he claims is his administration's economic progress. but strategists said a more forward looking message on the economy and attacks on trump's proposed tax cuts for wealthy americans and corporations should be more front and center in biden's campaign    and that thursday's debate gives him a chance to drive that message home. \\\"i think he ought not to try to argue to people that this is a great economy,\\\" said peter giangreco, an obama campaign alum. \\\"what obama would say was, 'we've made progress. there's more to do.' and if trump gets in, it's going to be a whole lot worse. and i think that's where you go after him. he's got the opportunity to say, 'this is the guy who's going to reward the people who are gouging you.'\\\" \\\"make the economic contrast about the next four years, not the last four years or the last eight years. to me, other than just showing strength, that's job number one.\\\" trump, meanwhile, has to reinforce his own contrast with biden, republicans said. polls show that more voters trust trump than biden on the top issues they care about, including the economy and immigration, offering trump what gop consultants called an advantage in a battle over who has the better record. that's on top of efforts by the former president and his allies to cast biden as too old and unfit for office. \\\"if i'm giving advice, i'd just say, do a strong comparative between your economy and joe biden's economy, and it narrows it down to one thing. it narrows it down to inflation,\\\" said one former trump campaign official who's in touch with his current team. \\\"anytime you're talking about anything else, whether it's biden's age, whether it's hunter, it's a distraction from the economy, and that's not the debate we need to have the win.\\\" going hand in hand with that is the need to come off as presidential, republicans said, in an acknowledgement of the character concerns that caused trump to shed voters in 2020, particularly in the suburbs. \\\"i think trump needs to appear reasonable, in command and not turn off independent voters, swing voters. the people that voted for him in 2016 but then voted against him in 2020, he needs to win them over,\\\" conant said. both candidates will have to navigate a unique debate format on thursday to get their messages across. cnn, the debate host, will be able to mute the contenders' microphones when they're not speaking. there will also be no audience in the atlanta television studio to play to. most republican and democratic strategists said the format benefits biden by robbing trump of the ability to overwhelm the president's answers with crosstalk and feed off the energy of an audience. \\\"i think the fact that trump cannot just bully the conversation and just talk over president biden constantly is a good thing for the president. i think that gives the president more opportunity to define a clear choice in the election, whether it comes to protecting democracy, protecting abortion rights or creating an economy that helps working families,\\\" said the source familiar with the biden campaign's strategy. still, some speculated that if the goal for trump is to come off as \\\"presidential,\\\" having the microphones cut off helps the former president by essentially preventing voters at home from hearing him try to derail the conversation. \\\"i think it's good for trump because it does enforce some discipline and allows for him to avoid those bad moments where he just comes off as a total bully,\\\" gop strategist david kochel told abc news. still, in the end, the debate may produce little or no change in the race. trump has barreled through seemingly campaign shattering events since his first run for the white house, surviving the \\\"access hollywood\\\" scandal, accused in two impeachments, republican electoral failures, felony convictions and more    all without seeing his polling affected by more than a few points. that make thinking debates could have a bigger impact seem quaint by comparison. \\\"it's hard to see how there is a big shift or a big thing in this race where there's also a lot of fairway left to play. i mean, you still have sentencing, conventions, vp, picks another debate. you have another five months, that's a lifetime,\\\" said gop pollster robert blizzard. \\\"just look at what's happened the last couple months, and the race just really has not fundamentally changed.\\\" yet given the race's stability and the outsized personalities of the two candidates, thursday's debate amounts to must see tv as much as virtually anything else this election cycle. \\\"i think it's going to be a good one,\\\" kochel predicted. \\\"it's got the potential to be one of those debates that we talk about for years.\\\" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\\n\\ncopyright 2025 the associated press. all rights reserved. a new ap norc poll finds that most u.s. adults plan to watch or listen to some

(ap photo/patrick semansky, file) washington (ap)   most u.s. adults plan to watch some element of thursday\\u2019s presidential debate and many think the event will be important for the campaigns of both president joe biden and former president donald trump, according to a new poll from the associated press norc center for public affairs research. both men remain broadly unpopular as they prepare to face off for the first time since 2020, although trump, the presumptive republican nominee, maintains a modest enthusiasm advantage with his base compared to biden, the democratic incumbent. about 6 in 10 u.s. adults say they are \\u201cextremely\\u201d or \\u201cvery\\u201d likely to watch the debate live or in clips, or read about or listen to commentary about the performance of the candidates in the news or social media. the poll suggests tens of millions of americans are likely to see or hear about at least part of thursday\\u2019s debate despite how unusually early it comes in the campaign season. both biden and trump supporters view the debate as a major test for their candidate   or just a spectacle not to miss. \\u201ci think it\\u2019s super important,\\u201d said victoria perdomo, a 44 year old stay at home mom and a trump supporter in coral springs, florida. \\u201cit shows america what you\\u2019re going to see for the next four years.\\u201d nic greene, a libertarian who is a registered independent, said he\\u2019ll likely vote for trump as the \\u201cleast worst candidate.\\u201d he doesn\\u2019t think debates do much to help voters make decisions, but he\\u2019s expecting to be entertained and plans to listen to post debate analysis on podcasts. \\u201ci think the majority of people have their minds made up with or without these debates,\\u201d he said. \\u201cit\\u2019s a circus.\\u201d about half, 47%, of americans say the debate is \\u201cextremely\\u201d or \\u201cvery\\u201d important for the success of biden\\u2019s campaign and about 4 in 10 say it\\u2019s highly important for trump\\u2019s campaign. about 3 in 10 americans say it is at least \\u201cvery\\u201d important for both campaigns. most democrats, 55%, think the upcoming debate is extremely or very important for the success of the biden campaign. about half of republicans, 51%, say the same thing about the importance of the debate for the trump campaign. only about one third of independents say the debate, taking place at a cnn studio in atlanta, is highly important for either campaign. arthur morris, a 40 year old operations manager at a major financial firm, is an undecided voter open to biden, trump or a third party option such as independent candidate robert f. kennedy, jr. he, along with a significant share of americans, has doubts about the mental capabilities of the aging candidates, and sees biden\\u2019s debate performance as an important test. \\u201ci need biden to demonstrate to me that he\\u2019s cogent enough to be able to hold this office and execute to the level that we need him to,\\u201d morris said. trump, meanwhile, needs to show he can be trusted after the jan. 6, 2021, attack on the u.s. capitol in which trump supporters disrupted the certification of his 2020 loss to biden and trump\\u2019s recent conviction in a hush money scheme, said morris, of lewiston, ohio. about 4 in 10 say they are likely to watch or listen to some or all of the debate live, while a similar share say they will watch or listen to clips later. another 4 in 10, roughly, expect to consume commentary about the debate and candidate performance in the news or on social media. republicans and democrats are more likely than independents to be following debate coverage in some capacity. biden and trump are each entering the debate with low favorability ratings. about 6 in 10 u.s. adults say they have a very or somewhat unfavorable view of biden, and a similar number have a negative view of trump. most americans, 56%, say they are \\u201cvery\\u201d or \\u201csomewhat\\u201d dissatisfied with biden being the democratic party\\u2019s likely nominee for president, and a similar majority are dissatisfied with trump as the likely gop nominee. the poll indicates that republicans continue to be more satisfied with a re nomination of trump than democrats are with an anticipated biden re nomination. six in 10 republicans are satisfied with trump as a nominee; just 42% of democrats say that about biden. about 3 in 10 u.s. adults are dissatisfied with both trump and biden as their party\\u2019s likely nominees   with independents and democrats being more likely than republicans to be dissatisfied with both. republicans and democrats are more likely to have a negative view of the opposing party\\u2019s candidate than they are to have a positive view of their own. about 9 in 10 republicans have an unfavorable view of biden, and about 9 in 10 democrats have a negative view of trump. by comparison, roughly 7 in 10 democrats have a favorable view of biden, and about 7 in 10 republicans have a positive view of trump. about 4 in 10 u.s. adults approve of how biden is handling his job as president, in line with where that number has stood for the past two years. biden\\u2019s approval rating among u.s. adults on handling the economy is similar, as is his handling of abortion policy. only 3 in 10 approve of his approach to immigration. \\u201ci do believe there has been some progress under biden, but i believe it\\u2019s congress who is the one stalling on any of the policies that biden wants to proceed with,\\u201d said jane quan bell, 70, a school librarian from chico, california, and a democrat. the conflict between the israelis and palestinians is an especially vulnerable spot for biden. with only 26% of u.s. adults approving of his handling of the issue, it\\u2019s well below his overall approval rating. nearly 6 in 10 democrats disapprove of his approach. the poll of 1,088 adults was conducted june 20 24, 2024, using a sample drawn from norc\\u2019s probability based amerispeak panel, which is designed to be representative of the u.s. population. the margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.0 percentage points. cooper reported from phoenix. a previous version of this story misspelled arthur morris\\u2019 last name. it is morris, not murray. copyright 2025 the associated press. all rights reserved.\\n\\npresident joe biden and former president donald trump squared off on thursday night in the first presidential debate of the 2024 election cycle. voters across the country have expressed concerned about the candidates' ages   mr biden is 81 and trump is 78   and the debate supercharged that anxiety. still, with weeks left until the conventions when each party will formalise their choice of candidate, supporters of both major parties feel they are left with few options. the bbc spoke to democratic, republican and independent voters who told us they are concerned about mr biden's fitness for the ticket. after thursday's debate, we asked them if his widely criticised performance will sway how they vote. we start with a voter who feels that she has no choice but to support the president. this long time democrat found the debate so hard to watch, she could barely keep the broadcast on. but regardless of the candidates' performances, she plans to vote blue in november. i didn\\u2019t watch the whole thing. i could not handle it, this is the best our country can do? if hillary would have walked out in her pantsuit i would have been happy as hell. i absolutely despise trump and everything he stands for   his lying, cheating and lack of morals. biden is a much better human being, but i felt so bad for him (at the debate) and it was such a disappointment. i was thinking state of the union \\\"jacked up joe\\\". no, what we got was everything that everyone saying was wrong with him just showed up on stage. i feel terrible for him and america, but we just have to ride it out. honestly, the debate really kind of disengaged me. i feel like there\\u2019s nothing i can do but vote blue, whoever it is. dominic identifies as a libertarian and voted third party in 2016 and 2020, but this time around he's fully backing the former president. i'm a fan of trump and i'm enthusiastically going to be voting for him. going into this debate, i thought the republicans were setting themselves up for failure. i actually am surprised biden did as poorly as he did, i thought he\\u2019d do better. i was moderately happy with trump. i thought he seemed much more presidential, especially compared to the debates last time around. he was really negative last time. i think he struck the perfect tone (at the debate). the trump you saw on stage was much different than the one you saw in 2016. the 2016 trump would have taken a lot more cheap shots at biden\\u2019s age. biden seemed very defeated in his body language. i think trump seemed very presidential with how he dealt with biden's age. i'm enthusiastically going to vote for trump at this point and i didn\\u2019t vote for him in either 2016 and 2020. [dominic texted a few minutes later] in 2016, you almost could've considered me a never trumper. my opinion on him has completely changed. connor is democrat who voted for biden in 2020. he plans to do the same in 2024, but is concerned about the president's age. i am nervous about a second biden term. there\\u2019s no doubt in my mind that the people surrounding biden are competent and have the ability to carry out the necessities of the executive branch. there\\u2019s also no doubt in my mind that biden has the best interest of this country at heart. that being said, i am less confident in the ability of biden to lead this country today than i ever have been. the biden administration's efforts on infrastructure, rallying our allies, pardoning of those with marijuana offences, investing in clean energy and forward looking technologies, and reducing prescription drug prices are all monumental actions. i think this first term has been fairly successful, which is why it pains me to say biden may not be the best figurehead for these policies or moment. i don\\u2019t think any of this could convince me to vote for trump. i simply could not get behind a candidate who has reduced faith in our election system dramatically while all his own advisers told him he was wrong. or a candidate who is clearly lacking in any moral character based on his extramarital affairs that have now been accepted as fact in a court of law and a myriad of other scandals. or a candidate that enables the worst sort of hatred and politicisation in every facet of our society and government. or a candidate who i have never heard speak intelligently or in depth about any topic ever. crystal is an ardent supporter of trump who voted for the former president twice before and will again in november. trump came across very level headed and presidential and biden came across very weak. i really did not think it was a good idea for biden to even do this debate. he actually did not look mentally sound to me. he came across really weak and feeble. it was painful to watch 90 minutes of this debate between biden and trump. the fentanyl crisis, border security and of course the economy are my top three concerns, and i did not feel like biden addressed those issues at all. i'm against abortion and against the abortion pill like trump. i like that he is pro life and i like that he sides with christian conservative values. i think this country respects him and after this debate, i really think he\\u2019ll win. this debate solidified that he can win and will win. shana plans to back biden in the upcoming election but is not happy with the country's current state of affairs. i was very frustrated watching the debate. i feel that the answers that they were giving weren\\u2019t really answers to any of the questions. it was exhausting to watch. i don\\u2019t think either of them performed better than the other. mr biden looked tired, he looked weak. even if he did have a cold and he had good things to say, he wasn't getting it out and he wasn\\u2019t understandable. that reminds me of how kennedy beat nixon in the first televised debate by looking healthier. trump was being aggressive, going off on tangents. although he appeared stronger in physicality, i don\\u2019t think he did well in content. i believe i'm still going to vote for mr biden because i don\\u2019t want mr trump in office. i would love it if both parties would reconsider their candidates. i know that idea is being thrown around right now, it would do us better. before biden announced running for re election, i was hoping he would step aside for someone else to come forward. but i would rather a democrat be in office than mr trump. eric is an independent voter who voted third party in 2020, but hasn't yet decided what he'll do come november. trump is old psychopathic liar who is running solely to keep himself out of jail and will say literally anything he can to protect himself. biden is old, feeble and out of touch with his constituency. personally, i think president biden does a better job at listening to different viewpoints. it was telling to me when the moderators would ask questions, trump would talk about what topics he wanted to. i'm undecided at this point, i'm going to wait and see what happens. a lot of things could change between now and november. personally, i don't see a compelling reason to vote for either person up there, but i do see compelling reasons to vote against people up there. i would like to see a candidate that i can get behind a vote for, rather than vote against somebody. i want someone who is more interested in doing the job than getting re elected again. neither trump nor biden are young. i don't know whether one of them can hold up to four years of being president. the fact that both of them were up there arguing about their golf game tells me they're more interested in other things than running a country. in the lead up to election day, bbc voter voices is hearing from americans around the country about what matters to them. aged just 10 when his father first became president, he's now well over six feet tall, and goes to new

images hide caption if some people who listened to the radio in 1960 thought richard nixon won the presidential debate with john f. kennedy, then maybe people reading the transcript of thursday night\\u2019s match up would think president biden won. maybe. but elections aren\\u2019t won in transcripts. the reality is, fairly or not, debates are often about optics   how the candidates present themselves, defend their records and parry attacks. and that\\u2019s why so many democrats are ringing the fire alarms after the first general election presidential debate of 2024. the biden campaign said the president had a cold to explain why he sounded so hoarse and weak. but biden\\u2019s stumbles right from the beginning played into his biggest vulnerability   his age and whether the 81 year old is up to the challenge of handling four more years in office. there were issues for trump, too, as he continued to spread falsehoods and bathe in the kinds of conspiratorial grievances that have turned off many voters. not much has changed the dynamics of this race; will anything that happened thursday night make a difference either? here are four takeaways from the first biden trump debate of this campaign: neither candidate is the official nominee yet. the national political conventions haven\\u2019t happened   but it\\u2019s next to impossible that democrats would replace biden. still, given he delivered the kind of performance democrats feared, party leaders, strategists and many voters, frankly, had to be wondering during this debate what it would be like if any of a handful of other democrats were standing on that stage. biden got a bit stronger as the debate went on, especially on foreign policy. he had some one liners, like calling trump a \\u201cwhiner\\u201d when trump wouldn\\u2019t definitively say that he would accept the results of the 2024 election. but biden often wasn\\u2019t able to show vigor or consistently convey what he wanted to say. he simply couldn\\u2019t deliver the kinds of happy warrior blows with that toothy smile audiences have seen from biden in years past. \\u201csometimes the spin don\\u2019t spin,\\u201d one democratic strategist texted midway through the debate when asked for reaction. an important rule of thumb for candidates   and moderators   in debates is to be conscious of how things look, of how you look, of what people are seeing at home. and what people saw   and this was predictable   was a split screen. biden wasn\\u2019t able to use that to his advantage at all, even as trump doled out falsehood after falsehood. instead, he looked genuinely shocked and confused, which is never a good look. trump and his base might not care about late night comedy, but this week\\u2019s monologues are going to sting democratic voters. the muting of the candidates was likely intended to make the debate calmer and not allow trump to run roughshod over the moderators or his opponent. but it had the effect of making trump seem more sedate than usual. trump employed rounds of verbal jujitsu, in which he threw back his own vulnerabilities and directed them toward biden. he was even able at one point, during a strange exchange about golf handicaps, to say, \\u201clet\\u2019s not act like children.\\u201d the moderation, or lack thereof, also allowed trump to spread falsehoods and hyperbole without being interrupted or corrected. cnn indicated before the debate that the moderators were not going to play a strong role in fact checking the candidates, and they lived up to that. they left it to the candidates, essentially, and with biden unable to deliver in real time and the moderators declining to, the audience was left with a salad bowl full of rotten eggs and moldy lettuce that passed for facts. fact check: what did biden and trump claim about immigration in the debate? despite biden\\u2019s struggles, which will understandably get the headlines, trump had some difficult moments, too, especially in the second half of the debate. in addition to spreading myriad falsehoods, he did little to credibly defend his conduct on and before the jan. 6 siege on the capitol; he used the kind of hyperbolic and vituperative language that has long turned off swing voters; and showed why many are concerned about some of his positions on the issues, especially on abortion and how the u.s. should be represented on the world stage. so despite biden\\u2019s shortcomings, millions will still likely vote for biden, anyway, because he\\u2019s not trump. the bottom line is: americans have said they are unhappy with their choices, and, in this   the biggest moment of the 2024 presidential campaign yet   it was clear why. a previous version of this story referenced this week's live snl episode but in fact the show is on its summer hiatus. sponsor message become an npr sponsor\\n\\nsupported by one network is in charge of every aspect of the biden trump debate, a major shift from previous years. tens of millions of viewers are expected to be watching. by michael m. grynbaum michael grynbaum is a media correspondent who covered the presidential debates in 2016 and 2020. the prime time matchup on thursday between president biden and former president donald j. trump represents an evening full of promise and peril. especially for cnn. for the first time in decades, a single television network will have sole discretion over the look, feel and cadence of a general election presidential debate. unlike in past years, when an independent, nonprofit commission oversaw the contests, cnn has picked the moderators, designed the set and will choose the camera angles that viewers see. lest any voters forget who\\u2019s in charge, the red cnn logo will be ubiquitous: rival channels seeking to simulcast the event had to agree to leave the network\\u2019s on air watermark untouched. the debate, at 9 p.m. eastern, could be the single most watched moment of the presidential campaign, with consequences that ripple all the way to november. and much of the credit   or the blame   for what transpires on tens of millions of screens on thursday will land at cnn\\u2019s feet. leaders at the channel, which has endured a run of poor ratings and viewer apathy, say they don\\u2019t mind the pressure. \\u201cthe fact that we got it was something of a moment for us,\\u201d mark thompson, who became cnn\\u2019s chairman in october, said in an interview between prep meetings in washington. \\u201cmuch of the reaction of the public, the rest of the media and other politicians is going to depend on president trump and president biden, who are the stars of the show.\\u201d\\n\\nthe first, and maybe only, debate between the 45th and 46th presidents of the united states constituted a clear win for donald trump, as far more viewers focused on joe biden\\u2019s apparent physical and mental infirmities than donald trump\\u2019s evasions and trafficking in partial or outright lies. the question now, though, is what, if any, difference it will make in the presidential election that is now just four months away. the debate most likely increases the odds that trump will occupy the oval office come noon on 20 january 2025. going into thursday night\\u2019s debate, trump was slightly ahead in many of the national polls and, more importantly, in the half dozen swing states that will most likely determine the election\\u2019s outcome. the debate only added to this advantage. the context favours trump. this year has already proven to be a tough one for incumbents seeking re election, as outcomes in india and france have demonstrated (with britain up next). polls also show a low approval rating for the prime ministers of japan and canada, which could lead to a change of leadership in those countries. biden and the us are poised to be consistent with this trend. like many of his fellow incumbents, biden has struggled to manage rising immigration and economic challenges. his failure to deal effectively with the southern border has allowed some 10 million people to enter the us illegally. then there are the effects of inflation, something voters are reminded of every time they go to grocery stores or fill their cars with gasoline. biden can point to domestic and foreign policy accomplishments, but they are less salient to many americans. most critical is the question of his age. doubts are widely and deeply held that biden is simply too old for what is arguably the world\\u2019s most demanding and important job. he is 81, turns 82 in november, and, if re elected, would turn 86 while still in the white house. and he is an old 81. as the debate demonstrated, he walks stiffly, loses his train of thought and has a weak and raspy voice. trump is only three years younger and makes little sense when he speaks, often taking bizarre rhetorical detours, but manages to project a more vigorous image. given biden\\u2019s better outing at a campaign stop the day after the debate, some believe he can bounce back. after all, ronald reagan and barack obama recovered from poor debate performances. but that was because each was seen as a great orator who had simply had a bad night. biden\\u2019s problem is that his poor showing reinforced an already entrenched narrative that will be difficult, if not impossible, to alter. his performance could even threaten to turn him into something of a lame duck, further weakening his influence at home and abroad. all this said, biden will be the democratic party candidate chosen at the party\\u2019s convention this august unless he takes himself out of the running and frees his pledged delegates to vote for someone else. who this someone would be vice president kamala harris, a sitting governor or senator, a member of his cabinet is anybody\\u2019s guess. it is obvious that biden and his inner circle are resisting calls (including from sympathetic editors at major news outlets) for him to step aside. neither he nor his loyal lieutenants, many of whom have been close to him for decades, have given any indication that the president will bow out. biden\\u2019s declining political fortunes could well prove to be a drag on other democratic candidates come autumn. it is possible that a trump victory could help bring about a republican takeover of the senate at the same time republicans hold the house of representatives. together with a supreme court that has increasingly demonstrated sympathy for positions supported by trump and congressional republicans, this would bring about the american equivalent of a parliamentary system, with power consolidated in the hands of a party one that is better understood as radical rather than conservative. there would be few checks on power strong enough to mitigate this imbalance; on the contrary, trump\\u2019s plans to weaken the independence of the civil service, together with his promise to politicise the justice department and regulatory agencies, would concentrate power further. trump would be free to lower taxes, impose tariffs, further restrict access to abortion, ease already loose controls on gun ownership, enforce immigration law as he sees fit and increase the enormous debt. foreign policy would also be vulnerable to significant change, because the us political system gives broad latitude to the executive. it is quite possible that trump would reduce or even eliminate us support for ukraine, hollow out us commitments to nato, give israel an even freer hand to prosecute war in gaza and lebanon and build settlements, refuse to participate in global efforts to combat climate change, and prioritise bilateral trade issues with china over broader concerns with beijing\\u2019s behaviour abroad. elections have consequences, and this one more than most, given that the differences between the candidates far exceed any similarities. in the wake of a debate that appears to have tipped the scales against biden, and with no way of knowing if someone else will be the democratic candidate and how he or she would fare, us friends and allies should prepare themselves for potentially major changes come january. richard haass, president emeritus of the council on foreign relations, is a senior counselor at centerview partners and the author of the bill of obligations: the ten habits of

president donald trump, thursday, june 27, 2024, in atlanta. (ap photo/gerald herbert) president joe biden strained to quell democratic anxieties over his unsteady showing in his debate with former president donald trump, as elected members of his party closed ranks around him in an effort to shut down talk of replacing him atop the ticket. biden\\u2019s halting delivery and meandering comments, particularly early in the debate, fueled concerns from even members of his own party that at age 81 he\\u2019s not up for the task of leading the country for another four years. even before the debate, biden\\u2019s age had been a liability with voters, and thursday night\\u2019s faceoff appeared to reinforce the public\\u2019s deep seated concerns before perhaps the largest audience he will garner before ballots are cast. democratic lawmakers on friday acknowledged biden\\u2019s poor showing, but tried to stop talk of replacing him as their standard bearer, and instead tried to shift the focus onto trump\\u2019s attacks and falsehoods that they hoped would remind voters of the daily turbulence of his presidency. \\u201cwell, the president didn\\u2019t have a good night, but neither did donald trump with lie after lie and his dark vision for america,\\u201d north carolina gov. roy cooper told the associated press on friday, hours before he was set to share a stage with the president in raleigh. \\u201cwe cannot send donald trump back to the white house. he\\u2019s an existential threat to our nation.\\u201d house democratic leader hakeem jeffries answered with a flat \\u201cno\\u201d when asked friday if biden should step aside. but the new york lawmaker added that he\\u2019s eager to see how biden would address his performance at his friday rally. \\u201ci\\u2019m looking forward to hearing from president biden,\\u201d he said. \\u201cand until he articulates a way forward in terms of his vision for america at this moment, i\\u2019m going to reserve comment about anything relative to where we are at this moment, other than to say i stand behind the ticket.\\u201d rep. ritchie torres, democrat of new york, said, \\u201csince performance last night, i had to take a few more antidepressants than usual.\\u201d \\u201cpeople

ever, as it looks to stave off trump. biden\\u2019s campaign announced that it raised $14 million on debate day and the morning after, while trump\\u2019s campaign said it raised more than $8 million from the start of the debate through the end of the night. vice president kamala harris, whom the biden campaign sent out to defend his performance, was set to travel to las vegas, nevada. she told cnn hours after the debate, \\u201cthere was a slow start, but it was a strong finish.\\u201d rep. emanuel cleaver, d mo., said he could hardly sleep because of the number of telephone calls he got after biden performed \\u201chorribly\\u201d in the debate. \\u201cpeople were just concerned. and i told everybody being concerned is healthy, overreacting is dangerous,\\u201d cleaver said. \\u201cand i think i wouldn\\u2019t advise anybody to make rash decisions right now.\\u201d rep. james clyburn, a south carolina democrat who was formerly a longtime fixture in house democratic leadership, said he would likely speak to biden later friday and his message would be simple: \\u201cstay the course.\\u201d biden and his allies were looking to brush aside concerns about his delivery to keep the focus on the choice for voters this november. they seized on trump\\u2019s equivocations on whether he would accept the will of voters this time around, his refusal to condemn the rioters who stormed the capitol on jan. 6, 2021, trying to overturn his 2020 loss to biden, and his embrace of the conservative leaning supreme court\\u2019s overturning of roe v. wade that had legalized abortion nationwide. trump\\u2019s comments, biden\\u2019s team insisted, are out of step with the majority of voters and will serve as fodder for the barrage of ads that they will see through election day. but democrats faulted biden for fumbling his chance to press those trump on those issues. philly\\u2019s suburbs are crucial to the presidential race. after the first debate, some voters are wincing at the biden trump rematch voters in bucks and montgomery counties could prove pivotal in deciding the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. 8 months ago r ep. bennie thompson of mississippi, who was the chairman of the house jan. 6 committee, said that while everything trump said about the attack that day was wrong, biden flubbed the moment. \\u201cthe president missed a golden opportunity, to correct the record, in the debate. that was a missed opportunity.\\u201d biden also fumbled on abortion rights, one of the most important issues for democrats in this year\\u2019s election. he was unable to explain roe v. wade, the landmark supreme court ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. a conservative supreme court with three justices nominated by trump overturned roe two years ago. as elected democrats united behind biden publicly, donors and party operatives shared panicked text messages and phone calls thursday night and into friday expressing their concern that biden\\u2019s performance was so bad that he may be unelectable this fall. but there were no immediate signs of organized efforts among donors, his campaign leadership or the democratic national committee to convince the president to step aside, according to interviews with several people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share sensitive conversations. still, morale was poor among some biden campaign staffers across the country, who had been encouraged by top campaign officials in delaware to organize hundreds of debate watch parties to get as many eyes as possible on the biden trump showdown. the morning after, some embarrassed lower level campaign staffers privately expressed their desire for biden to quit the race. it was the same among some top democratic donors, who talked up the need to embrace a biden replacement during a series of text chains. there were informal conversations between donors and those close to potential biden alternatives to gauge their willingness to step into the race. but there was no sense that a sitting governor or member of congress would be willing to risk the political fallout that might come with a public break from the democratic president. others donors skittish about biden\\u2019s performance faced determined outreach from his campaign warning that without their resources they risked handing the election to trump. michigan gov. gretchen whitmer, a democrat frequently mentioned as a 2028 contender and speculated about as a potential replacement for biden on the ticket should he step aside, released a statement backing him on friday. \\u201cthe difference between joe biden\\u2019s vision for making sure everyone in america has a fair shot and donald trump\\u2019s dangerous, self serving plans will only get sharper as we head toward november,\\u201d she said. california gov. gavin newsom also dismissed questions on whether he would consider stepping in for biden, telling reporters after the debate, \\u201ci will never turn my back on him.\\u201d under current democratic party rules, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to replace biden as the party\\u2019s nominee without his cooperation or without party officials being willing to rewrite the rules at the august national convention. trump, meanwhile, flew to his golf club in virginia, a onetime battleground that has shifted toward democrats in recent years but that his aides believe can flip toward the republican in november. he was set to hold at rally in chesapeake friday afternoon. ___

first presidential debate of 2024. in anticipation of this event, the johns hopkins briefing series hosted a virtual panel of experts to discuss the history and significance of presidential debates. the panel was moderated by snf agora institute associate professor of political science lilliana mason, whose research focuses on partisan identity, partisan bias, and american social polarization. the briefing series is hosted by the office of interdisciplinary initiatives. panelists included: when biden and trump square off on thursday night, they'll be achieving a number of firsts, not all of them positive, the panelists say. never has an incumbent president faced a former president in a debate. never have the two candidates been as old trump is 78, and biden, at 81, will be the first octogenarian to take the presidential debate stage. and never has a convicted felon participated in a debate for president, let alone run for the highest office in the country. this showdown, says rigueur, \\\"is completely unique in the history of televised media debate.\\\" even the structure and rules will be different. historically, debates have been held well into the election season, normally in september and october, a stark contrast to this year's june start date. to keep this debate from veering off course, there will be no audience, and moderators will have the power to mute candidates' microphones. maybe voters don't care who designed biden's suit or trump's tie, but how a candidate presents himself from his cadence of speech to the american flag pinned on his lapel is vitally important, according to the panelists. rigueur recalls the first televised presidential debate in 1960, where richard nixon infamously lost to john f. kennedy due to his lack of makeup and sweaty forehead. \\\"the real deal breaker was that kennedy was used to doing television,\\\" she says. \\\"he had an aesthetic and knew what it meant to talk to the american people.\\\" rigeuer notes that when viewers discuss who won the debate afterwards, style is often just as important as substance: \\\"we don't always remember candidates' talking points, but we do remember the way they presented themselves.\\\" \\\"think about that infamous hillary clinton versus donald trump debate [in 2020] where [the moderators] allowed the candidates to walk around the stage,\\\" she continues. \\\"one of the things that really stuck out for a lot of people was how donald trump followed hillary clinton as she was talking.\\\" ultimately, according to perrin, what matters is how a candidate makes voters feel, and in a year where many voters already feel uninspired by both candidates, broadcasting a particular image is especially important. according to rigueur, biden will have to assure voters he's still sharp despite his age, while trump will have to convince them that he is morally equipped for the job. while picking the next leader of the free world based on feelings might seem impractical, perrin gives another perspective: \\\"much of what happens in any presidential term is unpredictable,\\\" he says, citing incidents like 9/11 and the mortgage crisis of 2008. \\\"and so what you're trying to do [by watching a debate] is not get a sense of just what their agenda is, but actually what kind of leader we're trying to elect.\\\" he continues, \\\"it's a question of feeling what makes you trust or mistrust a candidate. who do you imagine they might ask for advice in the context of something really new happening? what kinds of expertise do they have access to, or do they consider [consulting experts at all]? to what extent do you have faith that the candidate is serious about considering the evidence when something happens?\\\" moderators have always played a key role in presidential debates, but in such a polarized political climate, they're crucial to maintaining a debate based on facts. pomerantsev explains, \\\"if you label the other person a liar and dismiss anything that comes out of their mouth, that destroys the ground for a debate where evidence matters. it's really going to be up to moderators to steer the debate in a way where facts can happen.\\\" this year, moderators have a new tool for reining in debaters: mute buttons. while pomerantsev hopes they're used with impartiality and only to penalize candidates for breaking debate rules, he also predicts the mute buttons will prove controversial with viewers. he compared their dilemma to that faced by soccer referees: \\\"even though the referee might be trying to be fair, [their choices] are always reinterpreted\\\" through viewers' various biases. the debate stage gives candidates opportunities that extend beyond simply sparring with their opponent. it provides a mouthpiece for carefully honed soundbites, which will inevitably make the rounds on social media channels. pomerantsev says debates are now \\\"raw material that will be chopped and changed, \\u2026 a rough cut \\u2026 used in completely other ways.\\\" he's noticed candidates adapting to this new trend, often trading cohesive narratives for quotable one liners. these quips aren't meant to sway undecided voters, but to shore up one's base. \\\"social media is for \\u2026 preaching to your tribe,\\\" explains pomerantsev. \\\"so if trump says something particularly incendiary around abortion, i'm pretty sure the democrats will leap on that. and the other way around, if biden stumbles in some way, that will definitely be used by republicans.\\\" when asked if these events are true debates or opportunities for candidates to recite memorized talking points, perrin insists it's more complex than that: \\\"the point of the debate is to allow both candidates to get themselves out there more directly \\u2026 than they do through advertisements and social media, and to allow the public to better understand who they are, what they stand for, and why. are they true debates in some sort of dialectic or philosophical society sense? no, they're not. but they provide a real and true distinction on the same stage between two starkly different choices for the most powerful office of the land. i think it's much less important whether it's a 'true' debate and much more important whether that contrast [between the two candidates] is faithfully and appropriately drawn for the public so they can learn from it.\\\" posted in voices+opinion, politics+society tagged politics, snf agora institute, election 2024\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\":

in that event. by richard goldstein growing up on an ohio farm, bob schul battled asthma and allergies. but he loved to run. he raced against his three brothers on the farmland and then ran the mile in high school and at miami university of ohio. on a rainy day in tokyo in october 1964, he won the olympic 5,000 meter race, besting what was considered the strongest field ever assembled for that event. schul, who died at 86 on sunday at a nursing home in middletown, ohio, became the only american to win olympic gold in the 5,000 and did it with a remarkable sprint in the final yards on a muddy cinder track. going into the 1960s, the u.s. running program had been known mainly for its sprint champions. that changed with a pair of storied achievements in tokyo. billy mills staged one of the most spectacular upsets in olympic track history by winning the 10,000 meter run. a few days later, schul got his own gold medal.\\n\\ntable of contents original layout in the beginning at tokyo there was a good deal of clatter about the new emerging forces indonesia and north korea, for example who emerged from the olympic village in a snit and went home. but when the games hit full stride last week a different kind of new emerging force emerged america's sensational distance runners. from an olympic obscurity that with two exceptions (horace ashenfelter's steeplechase gold medal in 1952 and johnny hayes's marathon victory in 1908) had extended in length to everything beyond 1,500 meters and in time through every olympic renewal since the first in athens in 1896, the u.s. moved suddenly to center stage. last sunday in a drizzling rain a tall, bony ohioan named bob schul won the 5,000 meter run, a race the u.s. had never won before (though an american was a very close second 32 years ago). schul, a 27 year old asthmatic who bundles off to california in midsummer to escape the pollen fallout in his native state, was the favorite in the race, as unlikely as that might seem when counted against america's record in the 5,000 in the past. but schul is a resolute, self assured man, one who trained under the equally imperative hungarian master, mihaly igloi, without allowing igloi to dominate him. when schul said before the race, \\\"i am the man to beat,\\\" he said it only as a man who knows precisely where he stands and more important, where he is going. schul could be the man to beat at almost any distance, he is that strong and that fast. there was a time when he appeared to be going nowhere, and he interrupted his education at miami of ohio to spend four years in the air force. but during the indoor track season last winter, under igloi's direction, he began leading where before he had followed, and in june, when he beat the new zealander bill baillie in 13:38 in a 5,000 meter run at the compton relays in california, he shattered baillie with a last quarter kick that could be felt all the way to tokyo. it was the fastest 5,000 of the year, and schul immediately became an international figure, at least in track circles.\",\n          \"the mccamish pavilion at georgia tech in atlanta on tuesday, june 25, 2024. it is the site of the press center

Catch it while you can: The show will last only 45 minutes.ByNina SiegalReporting from AmsterdamThe Dutch fashion designer Iris van Herpen, who counts Beyonc\\u00e9, Bj\\u00f6rk and Tilda Swinton among her regular clients, is known for dazzling haute couture pieces that resemble sculpture.Now she\\u2019s aiming to show that the equation also works the other way around: She\\u2019s not a fashion designer but an artist who happens to make pieces for the body.Van Herpen is planning an art exhibition, called \\u201cHybrid,\\u201d that took a year to plan but will run for just 45 minutes on June 24, as part of Paris Haute Couture Week.Why just 45 minutes? That\\u2019s shorter than a yoga class, some Netflix episodes or a nap.Compared to her usual presentation at Fashion Week, the designer said, it\\u2019s actually a long time.\\u201cNormally we do a runway show that takes only 15 minutes because the audience goes from one show to another. So this is very long for this setup,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThis show really is a hybrid performance,\\u201d she added. \\u201cThere are living performers doing the installation and it will be physically intense.\\u201d\",\n          \"Supported byJewelry Often Has a Message, but Sometimes It\\u2019s Hard to FindThe old practice of hiding words or symbols, or engraving letters too small to be read, has come into favor again.ByVictoria GomelskyIn 2014, Fie Isolde\\u2019s future husband wrote her a 28th birthday card that, she said, was \\u201cfull of dreams about all the things we were going to do.\\u201d\\u201cWhen I got the card,\\u201d the Danish jewelry designer recalled last month during a video interview from her boutique in the Sycamore neighborhood of Los Angeles, \\u201cmy first thought was actually my fear: One day, this ink will be gone.\\u201dSo in 2020, she had the words microscopically engraved on the 14-karat gold ring that she now wears on her right pinkie.\\u201cYou can\\u2019t read it with the naked eye, only with a loupe,\\u201d Ms. Isolde said, referring to the simple magnification eyepiece used in many industries. \\u201cPeople see it as small black lines or etchings.\\u201d\",\n          \"At Royal Ascot, the Hats \\u2018Err on the Side of Extravagance\\u2019Fascinators are banned at a storied British horse racing event that has a strict dress code codifying what it means to be a hat.The Royal Ascot is a horse race in England, but like the Kentucky Derby it is known nearly as much for its hats as it is for the racing.Credit...Supported byText byVanessa FriedmanPhotographs byLandon NordemanPiles of books, an entire topiary, a block of Stilton cheese, a pink flamingo \\u2014 all these and more have appeared on the heads of attendees at Royal Ascot, the five-day British racing event that is as famous for its outrageous millinery as its stallions. Hats may follow horses around the world, from the Kentucky Derby to the Dubai World Cup and the Hong Kong Cup, but nothing tops the \\u2026 well, toppers at Ascot, founded in 1711 by Queen Anne. They go together like strawberries and cream. Pimm\\u2019s and cucumber. Champagne and finger sandwiches.Perhaps it\\u2019s because of \\u201cMy Fair Lady\\u201d and the extraordinary black and white lace hat Cecil Beaton created for Eliza Doolittle when she made her Ascot debut. Or maybe it\\u2019s thanks to Queen Elizabeth II, whose twin passions for horses and hats reached their apex at Ascot. At this point, though, the game of hat-upmanship is as heated, and closely watched, as the races themselves.\\u201cTo err on the side of extravagance as opposed to modesty is a joy for everyone,\\u201d said the milliner Stephen Jones, who reported that he once made an Ascot hat out of feathers for Jasmine Guinness, the aristo-model, in the shape of a feathered pinwheel about two feet high. \\u201cThere are so few rules in dressing anymore that to dress up is part of the reason for going to Ascot. It\\u2019s the opportunity to do something you never do.\\u201dIndeed, theAscot dress codedictates that all attendees sport (ahem) hats \\u2014 and in the Royal Enclosure, the most exclusive ticket area, and the Windsors\\u2019s spot, they must include a base that is at least four inches in diameter.

multidisciplinary technologies are at the core of haute couture powerhouse iris van herpen\\u2019s creations, in which vision and artisanal craftsmanship collide. one of the most avant garde designers of our time, van herpen has been pushing her sustainable wearable art forward for the past 15 years. her repeat clients include lady gaga, bj\\u00f6rk and beyonc\\u00e9, all of whom have worn her custom made dresses on the world\\u2019s biggest red carpets. we had the chance to speak with van herpen in paris after her anniversary show, \\u201cmeta morphism,\\u201d this past july. why is this show so important, and what inspired you? \\u201ci really wanted to express everything the brand has been doing so far without looking backwards, because my work has always been about innovation and the future combined with craftsmanship. the starting point for this collection was posthumanism, a future where our digital reality and our physical reality are indistinguishable. there\\u2019s also the timeless question of \\u2018who are we beyond our physical bodies?\\u2019 i think that\\u2019s a very beautiful question that we might never be able to answer.\\u201d all your collections are based around technology, but the craft of haute couture is historically quite rigid. how do you navigate those parameters while incorporating innovation? \\u201ci think it\\u2019s in my nature. craftsmanship the knowledge of the haute couture techniques is the backbone of the atelier, and i need to innovate to make it feel relevant today. my focus within the collection is always to transform the body and create a reality in the movement with the garment. if i were to focus purely on traditional craftsmanship, i would not be able to achieve the fashion forward materiality of the looks. the transformation is only possible if i fuse the two.\\u201d you constantly develop materials to achieve specific movement, shapes and textures. are there any new ones in this collection? \\u201cyes, we\\u2019ve done some really beautiful collaborations this time. we\\u2019ve done a lot of 3 d printing in the past [to create materials], but this is the first time we were able to innovate in terms of [creating] sustainable materials. one that i really like is [made from] the banana leaf; it\\u2019s a very beautiful silklike shiny light material that still has a stiffness as it is organic, and it has a draping that i have never done before. we collaborated with dutch duo eric klarenbeek and maartje dros on printable filaments made out of cacao beans, which was really challenging. we also worked with [printing company] materialise, using an upcycled powder leftover from 3 d prints, and with [copper company] solaris on an upcycled organza.\\u201d it\\u2019s nice to see such sustainability, but it makes sense considering you\\u2019re constantly pursuing innovation. \\u201cthat\\u2019s where i see the value of couture, as it has always been an inspiration for ready to wear and an experimental laboratory. we can innovate new sustainable materials that can then go into mass production. i think it\\u2019s a very beautiful dialogue between the two [aspects of design]and they elevate one another.\\u201d most of your pieces are one offs for private clients. can you walk me through the process of making a couture garment? \\u201cmost of our clients come to see the show, and then they come to the showroom to look at the collection up close. either i\\u2019ll start drawing a custom piece or they\\u2019ll [choose] a look from the collection and we\\u2019ll adapt it to their measurements. they then often come to amsterdam to do an in between fitting, and we adjust accordingly. this is a three  to four month process. finally, there is a final fitting when the piece is done or we send it to them directly.\\u201d i\\u2019ve read that you produce only about 100 custom pieces per year. \\u201ci think it\\u2019s less than that, actually, because we are only about 30 people in the atelier and there are often seven or eight people working on a single order. when we start a piece, we have to translate the pattern work into the computer so the laser cutting can be done by the 3 d printer, and that alone can take three to four weeks. it then goes to a classic tailor to translate into normal pattern work, and only then can the laser cutting of the fabric start. we also have to educate the people in the atelier so they understand both the traditional and the technological sides of things, because you don\\u2019t learn this at the academy or at another house. this is also why we are quite limited in the amount of orders we take, because it requires the right people to keep the vision going. i also think that\\u2019s the reason clients can recognize an ivh [piece] it combines the past and the future to create a look that you cannot find elsewhere. i think that\\u2019s why we have regular clients who keep coming back to us.\\u201d are there any lessons you\\u2019ve learned over the past 15 years? \\u201ci think the biggest challenge [has been finding a] balance between identity and commerce. i feel i\\u2019ve been very consistent in my choices, and that\\u2019s why i now have complete freedom in terms of creativity, which is really valuable. i don\\u2019t have investors telling me \\u2018you have to do this\\u2019 or \\u2018you have to make that product.\\u2019 that\\u2019s what i\\u2019ve been fighting for for so long. it is the biggest luxury for me to have that freedom as an artist. if you build a brand, there are many people who try to influence you, give you advice, steer you into something. i feel i\\u2019ve been able to listen to the right people and be stubborn and therefore protect who i am.\\u201d source: elle. jun. 21, 2024

old iris van herpen\\u2019s technically advanced designs are true pieces of art. a guest member of the parisian syndicale de la haute couture, the dutch born designer is known to for creating fantasy couture collections which she showcases during paris couture week. an advocate of using a multidisciplinary approach to fashion design, the cutting edge couturier is known for her unconventional collaborations with physicists, scientists, architects, sculptors and artists to develop her collections. a true avant garde at heart, van harpen is constantly pushing boundaries through her unparalleled use of innovative materials, techniques and technologies to create one of a kind, illusory designs that redefine the principles of garment construction. her game changing approach to fashion has enabled her to amass a loyal celebrity clientele with the likes of cate blanchett, tilda swinton and beyonce clamoring to wear her designs. van herpen\\u2019s work has been showcased globally as part of prominent fashion and design exhibitions at the metropolitan museum of art in new york, the victoria & albert museum in london, the cooper hewitt museum in new york and the palais de tokyo in paris. the outstanding amsterdam based couturier has received widespread recognition for her visionary and has received the andam grand prix award, the starts prize and the johannes

by victoria gomelsky\\n\\nthe word ekphrasis, or ecphrasis, comes from the greek for the written description of a work of art produced as a rhetorical or literary exercise,[1] often used in the adjectival form ekphrastic. it is a vivid, often dramatic, verbal description of a visual work of art, either real or imagined. thus, \\\"an ekphrastic poem is a vivid description of a scene or, more commonly, a work of art.\\\"[2] in ancient times, it might refer more broadly to a description of any thing, person, or experience. the word comes from the greek \\u1f10\\u03ba ek and \\u03c6\\u03c1\\u03ac\\u03c3\\u03b9\\u03c2 phr\\u00e1sis, 'out' and 'speak' respectively, and the verb \\u1f10\\u03ba\\u03c6\\u03c1\\u03ac\\u03b6\\u03b5\\u03b9\\u03bd ekphr\\u00e1zein, 'to proclaim or call an inanimate object by name'. the works of art described or evoked may be real or imagined; and this may be difficult to discern. ancient ekphrastic writing can be useful evidence for art historians, especially for paintings, as virtually no original greco roman examples survive. ekphrasis has been considered generally to be a rhetorical device in which one medium of art tries to relate to another medium by defining and describing its essence and form, and in doing so, relate more directly to the audience, through its illuminative liveliness. a descriptive work of prose or poetry, a film, or even a photograph may highlight through its rhetorical vividness what is happening or what is shown. for example, in the visual arts, it may enhance the original art and so take on a life of its own through its brilliant description. one example is a painting of a sculpture: the painting is \\\"telling the story of\\\" the sculpture, and so becoming a storyteller, as well as a story (work of art) itself. virtually any type of artistic medium may be the actor of or subject of ekphrasis. although, for example, it may not be possible to make an accurate sculpture of a book to retell the story in an authentic way, it is the spirit of the book that may be conveyed by virtually any medium and thereby enhance the artistic impact of the original book through synergy. in the republic, book x, plato discusses forms by using real things, such as a bed, for example, and calls each way a bed has been made a \\\"bedness\\\". he commences with the original form of a bed, one of a variety of ways a bed may have been constructed by a craftsman and compares that form with an ideal form of a bed, of a perfect archetype or image in the form of which beds ought to be made; in short, the epitome of bedness. in his analogy, one bedness form shares its own bedness   with all its shortcomings   with that of the ideal form, or template. a third bedness, too, may share the ideal form. he continues with the fourth form also containing elements of the ideal template or archetype which in this way remains an ever present and invisible ideal version with which the craftsman compares his work. as bedness after bedness shares the ideal form and template of all creation of beds, and each bedness is associated with another ad infinitum, it is called an \\\"infinite regress of forms\\\". it was this epitome, this template of the ideal form, that a craftsman or later an artist would try to reconstruct in his attempt to achieve perfection in his work, that was to manifest itself in ekphrasis at a later stage. artists began to use their own literary and artistic genre of art to work and reflect on another art to illuminate what the eye might not see in the original, to elevate it and possibly even surpass it. for plato (and aristotle), it is not so much the form of each bed that defines bedness[3] as the mimetic stages at which beds may be viewed that defines bedness. in plato's phaedrus, socrates talks about ekphrasis to phaedrus, saying: the fullest example of ekphrasis in antiquity can be found in philostratus of lemnos' eikones which describes 64 pictures in a neapolitan villa. modern critics have debated as to whether the paintings described should be considered as real or imagined, or the reader left uncertain. ekphrasis is described in aphthonius' progymnasmata, his textbook of style, and later classical literary and rhetorical textbooks, and with other classical literary techniques. it was keenly revived in the renaissance. in the middle ages, ekphrasis was less often practiced, especially regarding real objects. historians of medieval art have complained that the accounts of monastic chronicles recording now vanished art concentrate on objects made from valuable materials or with the status of relics. they rarely give more than the cost and weight of objects, and perhaps a mention of the subject matter of the iconography. the renaissance and baroque periods made much use of ekphrasis, typically mainly of imagined works. in renaissance italy, canto 33 of ariosto's orlando furioso describes a picture gallery created by merlin. in spain, the playwright lope de vega often used allusions and descriptions of italian art in his works, and included the painter titian as one of his characters. calder\\u00f3n de la barca also incorporated works of art in dramas such as the painter of his dishonor. miguel de cervantes, who spent his youth in italy, used many renaissance frescoes and paintings in don quixote and many of his other works. in england, shakespeare briefly describes a group of erotic paintings in cymbeline, but his most extended exercise is a 200 line description of the greek army before troy in the rape of lucrece. ekphrasis seems to have been less common in france during these periods. instances of ekphrasis in 19th century literature can be found in the works of such influential figures as spanish novelist benito p\\u00e9rez gald\\u00f3s, french poet, painter and novelist th\\u00e9ophile gautier, norwegian playwright henrik ibsen, and russian novelist fyodor dostoyevsky. herman melville's moby dick features an intense use of ekphrasis as a stylistic manifesto of the book in which it appears. in the chapter \\\"the spouter inn\\\", a painting hanging on the wall of a whaler's inn is described as irreconcilably unclear, overscrawled with smoke and defacements. the narrator describes how this painting can be both lacking any definition and still provoking in the viewer dozens of distinct possible understandings, until the great mass of interpretations resolves into a whale. this grounds all the interpretations while containing them, an indication of how melville sees his own book unfolding around this chapter. peter bly has described the many uses of art in the works of benito p\\u00e9rez gald\\u00f3s. for example, in la inc\\u00f3gnita (1889), there are many allusions and descriptions of italian art, including references to botticelli, mantegna, masaccio, raphael, titian, and others. in our friend manso (1882), the narrator describes two paintings by th\\u00e9odore g\\u00e9ricault to point to the shipwreck of ideals. in this novel, as well as in miau (1888), as frederick a. de armas has pointed out, there are numerous allusive ekphrasis to paintings of bartholomew the apostle. in ibsen's 1888 work the lady from the sea, the first act begins with the description of a painting of a mermaid dying on the shore and is followed by a description of a sculpture that depicts a woman having a nightmare of an ex lover returning to her. both works of art can be interpreted as having much importance in the overall meaning of the play as protagonist ellida wangel both yearns for her lost youth spent on an island out at sea and is later in the play visited by a lover she thought dead. furthermore, as an interesting example of the back and forth dynamic that exists between literary ekphrasis and art, in 1896 (eight years after the play was written) norwegian painter edvard munch painted an image similar to the one described by ibsen in a painting he also entitled lady from the sea. ibsen's last work, when we dead awaken, also contains examples of ekphrasis; the play's protagonist, arnold rubek, is a sculptor. several times throughout the play he describes his masterpiece \\\"resurrection day\\\" at length and in the many different forms the sculpture took throughout the stages of its creation. once again the evolution of the sculpture as described in the play can be read as a reflection on the transformation undergone by rubek himself and even as a statement on the progression ibsen's own plays took. many scholars have read this final play (stated by ibsen himself to be an 'epilogue') as the playwright's reflection on his own work as an artist. the russian novelist fyodor dostoyevsky employed ekphrasis most notably in his novel the idiot. in this novel, the protagonist, prince myshkin, sees a painting of a dead christ in the house of rogozhin that has a profound effect on him. later in the novel, another character, hippolite, describes the painting at much length depicting the image of christ as one of brutal realism that lacks any beauty or sense of the divine. rogozhin, who is himself the owner of the painting, at one moment says that the painting has the power to take away a man's faith. this is a comment that dostoyevsky himself made to his wife anna upon seeing the actual painting that the painting in the novel is based on, the body of the dead christ in the tomb by hans holbein. the painting was seen shortly before dostoyevsky began the novel. though this is the major instance of ekphrasis in the novel, and the one which has the most thematic importance to the story as a whole, other instances can be spotted when prince myshkin sees a painting of swiss landscape that reminds him of a view he saw while at a sanatorium in switzerland, and also when he first sees the face of his love interest, nastasya, in the form of a painted portrait. at one point in the novel, nastasya, too, describes a painting of christ, her own imaginary work that portrays christ with a child, an image which naturally evokes comparison between the image of the dead christ. the irish aesthete and novelist oscar wilde's the picture of dorian gray (1890/1891) tells how basil hallward paints a picture of the young man named dorian gray. dorian meets lord henry wotton, who espouses a new hedonism, dedicated to the pursuit of beauty and all pleasures of the senses. under his sway, dorian bemoans the fact that his youth will soon fade. he would sell his soul so as to have the portrait age rather than himself. as dorian engages in a debauched life, the gradual deterioration of the portrait becomes a mirror of his soul. there are repeated instances of notional ekphrasis of the deteriorating figure in the painting throughout the novel, although these are often partial, leaving much of the portrait's imagery to the imagination. the novel forms part of the magic portrait genre. wilde had previously experimented with employing portraits in his written work, as in \\\"the portrait of mr. w. h.\\\" (1889). anthony powell's novel sequence a dance to the music of time begins with an evocation of the painting by poussin which gives the sequence its name, and contains other passages of ekphrasis, perhaps influenced by the many passages in marcel proust's in search of lost time. in the 20th century, roger zelazny's \\\"24 views of mt. fuji, by hokusai\\\" uses an ekphrastic frame, descriptions of hokusai's famous series of woodcuts, as a structural device for his story. in her novel skyline the south african italian patricia schonstein concludes each chapter with an art curator's description of a na\\u00efve work of art as a means of introducing additional narrative voices. ekphrasis and the uses of art, architecture and music are also of utmost importance in the modern latin american novel, and particularly in the works of alejo carpentier as steve wakefield attests. in one of his early novels, the kingdom of this world (1949), a character views a collection of statues at the villa borghese, culminating with the venus victrix. the art collection of the tyrant in reasons of state is another example. ekphrastic poetry may be encountered as early as the days of homer, whose iliad (book 18) describes the shield of achilles, with how hephaestus made it as well as its completed shape.[5] famous later examples are found in virgil's aeneid, for instance the description of what aeneas sees engraved on the doors of carthage's temple of juno, and catullus 64, which contains an extended ekphrasis of an imaginary coverlet with the story of ariadne picked out on it. ekphrastic poetry flourished in the romantic era and again among the pre raphaelite poets. a major poem of the english romantics   \\\"ode on a grecian urn\\\" by john keats   provides an example of the artistic potential of ekphrasis. the entire poem is a description of a piece of pottery that the narrator finds evocative. felicia hemans made extensive use of ekphrasis,[6] as did letitia elizabeth landon, especially in her poetical sketches of modern pictures. dante gabriel rossetti's \\\"double works\\\" exemplify the use of the genre by an artist mutually to enhance his visual and literary art. rossetti also ekphrasized a number of paintings by other artists, generally from the italian renaissance, such as leonardo da vinci's virgin of the rocks.[7] other examples of the genre from the nineteenth century include michael field's 1892 volume sight and song, which contains only ekphrastic poetry; algernon charles swinburne's poem \\\"before the mirror\\\", which ekphrasizes james abbott mcneill whistler's symphony in white, no. 2: the little white girl, hinted at only by the poem's subtitle, \\\"verses written under a picture\\\"; and robert browning's \\\"my last duchess\\\", which although a dramatic monologue, includes some description by the duke of the portrait before which he and the listener stand. ekphrastic poetry is still commonly practiced. twentieth century examples include rainer maria rilke's \\\"archaic torso of apollo\\\",[8] and the shield of achilles (1952), a poem by w. h. auden,[5] which brings the tradition back to its start with an ironic retelling of the episode in homer (see above), where thetis finds very different scenes from those she expects. in contrast, his earlier poem \\\"mus\\u00e9e des beaux arts\\\" describes a particular real and famous painting, landscape with the fall of icarus, thought until recently to be by pieter brueghel the elder, and now believed to be \\\"after\\\" him, is also described in the poem by william carlos williams \\\"landscape with the fall of icarus\\\". the paintings of edward hopper have inspired many ekphrastic poems, including a prize winning volume in french by claude esteban (soleil dans une pi\\u00e8ce vide, sun in an empty room, 1991),[9] a collection in catalan by ernest farr\\u00e9s (edward hopper, 2006, english translation 2010 by lawrence venuti), an english collection by james hoggard triangles of light: the edward hopper poems (wings press, 2009), and a collection by various poets (the poetry of solitude: a tribute to edward hopper, 1995, editor gail levin), together with numerous individual poems; see more at edward hopper \\u00a7 influence. the poet gabriele tinti has composed a series of poems for ancient works of art, including the boxer at rest, the discobolus, the arundel head, the ludovisi gaul, the victorious youth,[10] the farnese hercules, the hercules by scopas,[11] the elgin marbles from the parthenon, the barberini faun, the doryphoros. since the types of objects described in classical ekphrases often lack survivors to modern times, art historians have often been tempted to use descriptions in literature as sources for the appearance of actual greek or roman art, an approach full of risk. this is because ekphrasis typically contains an element of competition with the art it describes, aiming to demonstrate the superior ability of words to \\\"paint a picture\\\". many subjects of ekphrasis are clearly imaginary, for example those of the epics, but with others it remains uncertain the extent to which they were, or were expected to be by early audiences, at all accurate. this tendency is not restricted to classical art history; the evocative but vague mentions of objects in metalwork in beowulf are eventually always mentioned by writers on anglo saxon art, and compared to the treasures of sutton hoo and the staffordshire hoard. the ekphrasic writings of the lawyer turned bishop asterius of amasea (fl. around 400) are often cited by art historians of the period to fill gaps in the surviving artistic record. the inadequacy of most medieval accounts of art is mentioned above; they generally lack any specific details other than cost and the owner or donor, and hyperbolic but wholly vague praise. journalistic art criticism was effectively invented by denis diderot in his long pieces on the works in the paris salon, and extended and highly pointed accounts of the major exhibitions of new art became a popular seasonal feature in the journalism of most western countries. since few if any of the works could be illustrated, description and evocation was necessary, and the criticality of descriptions of works disliked became a part of the style. as art history began to become an academic subject in the 19th century, ekphrasis as formal analysis of objects was regarded as a vital component of the subject. not all examples lack attractiveness as literature. writers on art for a wider audience produced many descriptions with great literary as well as art historical merit; in english john ruskin, both the most important journalistic critic and popularizer of historic art of his day, and walter pater, above all for his famous evocation of the mona lisa, are among the most notable. as photography in books or on television allowed audiences a direct visual comparison to the verbal description, the role of ekphrasic commentary on the images may have increased. ekphrasis has also been an influence on art; for example the ekphrasis of the shield of achilles in homer and other classical examples are likely to have inspired the elaborately decorated large serving dishes in silver or silver gilt, crowded with complicated scenes in relief, that were produced in 16th century mannerist metalwork. there are a number of examples of ekphrasis in music, of which the best known is probably pictures at an exhibition, a suite in ten movements (plus a recurring, varied promenade) composed for piano by the russian composer modest mussorgsky in 1874, and then very popular in various arrangements for orchestra. the suite is based on real pictures, although as the exhibition was dispersed, most are now unidentified. the first movement of three places in new england by charles ives is an ekphrasis of the robert gould shaw memorial in boston, sculpted by augustus saint gaudens. ives also wrote a poem inspired by the sculpture as a companion piece to the music.[12] rachmaninoff's symphonic poem isle of the dead is a musical evocation of b\\u00f6cklin's painting of the same name. king crimson's song \\\"the night watch\\\", with lyrics written by richard palmer james, is an ekphrasis on rembrandt's painting the night watch. notional ekphrasis may describe mental processes such as dreams, thoughts and whimsies of the imagination. it may also be one art describing or depicting another work of art which as yet is still in an inchoate state of creation, in that the work described may still be resting in the imagination of the artist before he has begun his creative work. the expression may also be applied to an art describing the origin of another art, how it came to be made and the circumstances of its being created. finally it may describe an entirely imaginary and non existing work of art, as though it were factual and existed in reality. the shield of achilles is described by homer in an example of ekphrastic poetry, used to depict events that have occurred in the past and events that will occur in the future. the shield contains images representative of the cosmos and the inevitable fate of the city of troy. the shield of achilles features the following nine depictions: although not written as elaborately as previous examples of ekphrastic poetry, from lines 609 614 the belt of herakles is described as having \\\"marvelous works,\\\"[13] such as animals with piercing eyes and hogs in a grove of trees. it also contains multiple images of battles and occurrences of manslaughter. in the odyssey, there is also a scene where odysseus, disguised as a beggar, must prove to his wife, penelope, that he has proof that odysseus is still alive. she asks him about the clothes odysseus was wearing during the time when the beggar claims he hosted odysseus. homer uses this opportunity to implement more ekphrastic imagery by describing the golden brooch of odysseus, which depicts a hound strangling a fawn that it captured.[13] the cloak of jason is another example of ekphrastic poetry. in the argonautika,[14] jason's cloak has seven events embroidered into it: the description of the cloak provides many examples of ekphrasis, and not only is modeled on homer's writing, but alludes to several occurrences in homer's epics the iliad and the odyssey. jason's cloak can be examined in many ways. the way the cloak's events are described is similar to the catalogue of women that odysseus encounters on his trip to the underworld.[15] the cloak and its depicted events lend more to the story than a simple description; in true ekphrasis fashion it not only compares jason to future heroes such as achilles and odysseus, but also provides a type of foreshadowing. jason, by donning the cloak, can be seen as a figure who would rather resort to coercion, making him a parallel to odysseus, who uses schemes and lies to complete his voyage back to ithaca.[16] jason also bears similarities to achilles: by donning the cloak, jason is represented as an achillean heroic figure due to the comparisons made between his cloak and the shield of achilles. he also takes up a spear given to him by atalanta, not as an afterthought, but due to his heroic nature and the comparison between himself and achilles.[17] while jason only wears the cloak while going to meet with hypsipyle, it foreshadows the changes that jason will potentially undergo during his adventure. through the telling of the scenes on the cloak, apollonios relates the scenes on the cloak as virtues and morals that should be upheld by the roman people, and that jason should learn to live by. such virtues include the piety represented by the cyclops during the forging of zeus' thunderbolts.[18] this is also reminiscent of the scene in the iliad when thetis goes to see hephaestus, and requisitions him to create a new set of armor for her son achilles. before he began creating the shield and armor, hephaestus was forging 20 golden tripods for his own hall, and in the scene on jason's cloak we see the cyclops performing the last step of creating the thunderbolts for zeus.[19] the aeneid is an epic that was written by virgil during the reign of augustus, the first emperor of rome. while the epic itself mimics homer's works, it can be seen as propaganda for augustus and the new roman empire.[20] the shield of aeneas is described in book eight, from lines 629 719.[21] this shield was given to him by his mother, venus, after she asked her husband vulcan to create it.[21] this scene is almost identical to thetis, the mother of achilles, asking hephaestus to create her son new weapons and armor for the battle of troy. the difference in the descriptions of the two shields are easily discernible; the shield of achilles depicts many subjects, whereas the shield made for aeneas depicts the future that rome will have, containing propaganda in favor of the emperor augustus.[20] much like other ekphrastic poetry, it depicts a clear catalogue of events: there is speculation as to why virgil depicted certain events, while completely avoiding others such as julius caesar's conquest of gaul. virgil clearly outlined the shield chronologically, but scholars argue that the events on the shield are meant to reflect certain roman values that would have been of high importance to the roman people and to the emperor.[22] these values may include virtus, clementia, iustitia, and pietas, which were the values inscribed on a shield given to augustus by the senate.[23] this instance of ekphrasitc poetry may be virgil's attempt to relate more of his work to augustus. earlier in the epic, when aeneas travels to carthage, he sees the temple of the city, and on it are great works of art that are described by the poet using the ekphrastic style. like the other occurrences of ekphrasis, these works of art describe multiple events. out of these, there are eight images related to the trojan war:[21] another significant ekphrasis in the aeneid appears on the baldric of pallas (aeneid x.495 505). the baldric is decorated with the murder of the sons of aegyptus by their cousins, the dana\\u00efds, a tale dramatized by aeschylus. pallas is killed by the warrior turnus, who plunders and wears the baldric. at the climax of the poem, when aeneas is on the point of sparing turnus's life, the sight of the baldric changes the hero's mind. the significance of the ekphrasis is hotly debated.[24] there are several examples of ekphrasis in the metamorphoses; one in which phaeton journeys to the temple of the sun to meet his father phoebus. when phaeton gazes upon the temple of the sun, he sees the following carvings:[25] the rationale behind using examples of ekphrasis to teach literature is that once the connection between a poem and a painting are recognized, for example, the student's emotional and intellectual engagement with the literary text is extended to new dimensions. the literary text takes on new meaning and there is more to respond to because another art form is being evaluated.[26] in addition, as the material taught has both a visual and linguistic basis new connections of understanding are formed in the student's brain thus creating a stronger foundation for understanding, remembrance and internalization. using ekphrasis to teach literature can be done through the use of higher order thinking skills such as distinguishing different perspectives, interpreting, inferring, sequencing, compare and contrast and evaluating.[citation needed]\\n\\nthe code of hammurabi is a babylonian legal text composed during 1755 1750 bc. it is the longest, best organized, and best preserved legal text from the ancient near east. it is written in the old babylonian dialect of akkadian, purportedly by hammurabi, sixth king of the first dynasty of babylon. the primary copy of the text is inscribed on a basalt stele .mw parser output .frac{white space:nowrap}.mw parser output

susa in present day iran, where it had been taken as plunder six hundred years after its creation. the text itself was copied and studied by mesopotamian scribes for over a millennium. the stele now resides in the louvre museum. the top of the stele features an image in relief of hammurabi with shamash, the babylonian sun god and god of justice. below the relief are about 4,130 lines of cuneiform text: one fifth contains a prologue and epilogue in poetic style, while the remaining four fifths contain what are generally called the laws. in the prologue, hammurabi claims to have been granted his rule by the gods \\\"to prevent the strong from oppressing the weak\\\". the laws are casuistic, expressed as \\\"if ... then\\\" conditional sentences. their scope is broad, including, for example, criminal law, family law, property law, and commercial law. modern scholars responded to the code with admiration at its perceived fairness and respect for the rule of law, and at the complexity of old babylonian society. there was also much discussion of its influence on the mosaic law. scholars quickly identified lex talionis the \\\"eye for an eye\\\" principle underlying the two collections. debate among assyriologists has since centred around several aspects of the code: its purpose, its underlying principles, its language, and its relation to earlier and later law collections. despite the uncertainty surrounding these issues, hammurabi is regarded outside assyriology as an important figure in the history of law and the document as a true legal code. the u.s. capitol has a relief portrait of hammurabi alongside those of other historic lawgivers. there are replicas of the stele in numerous institutions, including the headquarters of the united nations in new york city and the pergamon museum in berlin. hammurabi (or hammurapi), the sixth king of the amorite first dynasty of babylon, ruled from 1792 to 1750 bc (middle chronology). he secured babylonian dominance over the mesopotamian plain through military prowess, diplomacy, and treachery. when hammurabi inherited his father sin muballit's throne,[3] babylon held little local sway; the local hegemon was rim sin of larsa. hammurabi waited until rim sin grew old, then conquered his territory in one swift campaign, leaving his organisation intact.[4] later, hammurabi betrayed allies in eshnunna, elam, and mari to gain their territories.[5] hammurabi had an aggressive foreign policy, but his letters suggest he was concerned with the welfare of his many subjects and was interested in law and justice.[6] he commissioned extensive construction works, and in his letters, he frequently presents himself as his people's shepherd.[7] justice is also a theme of the prologue to the code,[8] and \\\"the word translated 'justice' [e\\u0161\\u0113rum]... is one whose root runs through both prologue and epilogue\\\".[9] although hammurabi's code was the first mesopotamian law collection to be discovered, it was not the first written; several earlier collections survive. these collections were written in sumerian and akkadian. they also purport to have been written by rulers. there were almost certainly more such collections, as statements of other rulers suggest the custom was widespread.[10] the similarities between these law collections make it tempting to assume a consistent underlying legal system.[10] as with the code of hammurabi, however, it is difficult to interpret the purpose and underlying legal systems of these earlier collections, prompting numerous scholars to question whether this should be attempted.[11] extant collections include: there are additionally thousands of documents from the practice of law, from before and during the old babylonian period. these documents include contracts, judicial rulings, letters on legal cases, and reform documents such as that of urukagina, king of lagash in the mid 3rd millennium bc, whose reforms combatted corruption. mesopotamia has the most comprehensive surviving legal corpus from before the digest of justinian, even compared to those from ancient greece and rome.[13] the first copy of the text found, and still the most complete, is on a 2.25 m (7 ft 4+1\\u20442 in) stele. the stele is now displayed on the ground floor of the louvre, in room 227 of the richelieu wing. [14] at the top is an image of hammurabi with shamash, the babylonian sun god and god of justice. below the image are about 4,130 lines of cuneiform text: one fifth contains a prologue and epilogue, while the remaining four fifths contain what are generally called the laws.[15] near the bottom, seven columns of the laws, each with more than eighty lines, were polished and erased in antiquity.[16] the stele was found in three large fragments and reconstructed.[17] it is 225 cm (7 ft 4+1\\u20442 in) high, with a circumference is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) at the summit and 190 cm (6 ft 3 in) at the base.[17] hammurabi's image is 65 cm (2 ft 1+1\\u20442 in) high and 60 cm (1 ft 11+1\\u20442 in) wide.[17] the louvre stele was found at the site of the ancient elamite city of susa. susa is in modern day khuzestan province, iran (persia at the time of excavation). the stele was excavated by the french archaeological mission under the direction of jacques de morgan.[18] father jean vincent scheil published the initial report in the fourth volume of the reports of the delegation to persia (m\\u00e9moires de la d\\u00e9l\\u00e9gation en perse). according to scheil, the stele's fragments were found on the tell of the susa acropolis (l'acropole de suse), between december 1901 and january 1902.[17] the few, large fragments made assembly easy.[17] scheil hypothesised that the stele had been taken to susa by the elamite king shutruk nakhunte and that he had commissioned the erasure of several columns of laws to write his legend there.[17] it has been proposed that the relief portion of the stele, especially the beards of hammurabi and shamash, was reworked at the same time.[19] roth suggests the stele was taken as plunder from sippar,[20] where hammurabi lived towards the end of his reign.[21] fragments of a second and possibly third stele recording the code were found along with the louvre stele at susa.[22] over fifty manuscripts containing the laws are known. they were found not only in susa but also in babylon, nineveh, assur, borsippa, nippur, sippar, ur, larsa, and more.[23] copies were created during hammurabi's reign, and also after it, since the text became a part of the scribal curriculum.[24] copies have been found dating from one thousand years after the stele's creation,[16] and a catalog from the library of neo assyrian king ashurbanipal (685 631 bc) lists a copy of the \\\"judgments of hammurabi\\\".[25] the additional copies fill in most of the stele's original text, including much of the erased section.[16] the editio princeps of the code was published by father jean vincent scheil in 1902,[26] in the fourth volume of the reports of the delegation to persia (m\\u00e9moires de la d\\u00e9l\\u00e9gation en perse). after a brief introduction with details of the excavation,[27] scheil gave a transliteration and a free translation into french,[28] as well as a selection of images.[29] editions in other languages soon followed: in german by hugo winckler in 1902,[30] in english by c. h. w. johns in 1903,[31] and in italian by pietro bonfante, also in 1903.[32] the code was thought to be the earliest mesopotamian law collection when it was rediscovered in 1902 for example, c. h. w. johns' 1903 book was titled the oldest code of laws in the world.[31] the english writer h. g. wells included hammurabi in the first volume of the outline of history, and to wells too the code was \\\"the earliest known code of law\\\".[33] however, three earlier collections were rediscovered afterwards: the code of lipit ishtar in 1947, the laws of eshnunna in 1948, and the code of ur nammu in 1952.[34] early commentators dated hammurabi and the stele to the 23rd century bc.[35] however, this is an earlier estimate than even the \\\"ultra long chronology\\\" would support. the code was compiled near the end of hammurabi's reign.[36] this was deduced partly from the list of his achievements in the prologue.[37] scheil enthused about the stele's importance and perceived fairness, calling it \\\"a moral and political masterpiece\\\".[17] c. h. w. johns called it \\\"one of the most important monuments in the history of the human race\\\".[38] he remarked that \\\"there are many humanitarian clauses and much protection is given the weak and the helpless\\\",[39] and even lauded a \\\"wonderful modernity of spirit\\\".[40] john dyneley prince called the code's rediscovery \\\"the most important event which has taken place in the development of assyriological science since the days of rawlinson and layard\\\".[41] charles francis horne commended the \\\"wise law giver\\\" and his \\\"celebrated code\\\".[42] james henry breasted noted the code's \\\"justice to the widow, the orphan, and the poor\\\", but remarked that it \\\"also allows many of the old and na\\u00efve ideas of justice to stand\\\".[43] commentators praised the advanced society they believed the code evinced.[44] several singled out perceived secularism: owen jenkins,[45] for example, but even charles souvay for the catholic encyclopedia, who opined that unlike the mosaic law the code was \\\"founded upon the dictates of reason\\\".[26] the question of the code's influence on the mosaic law received much early attention.[46] scholars also identified hammurabi with the biblical figure amraphel,[47] but this proposal has since been abandoned.[48] the relief appears to show hammurabi standing before a seated shamash.[22] shamash wears the horned crown of divinity[49] and has a solar attribute, flames,[50] spouting from his shoulders.[51] contrastingly, scheil, in his editio princeps,[26] identified the seated figure as hammurabi and the standing figure as shamash. scheil also held that the scene showed shamash dictating to hammurabi while hammurabi held a scribe's stylus, gazing attentively at the god.[17] martha roth lists other interpretations: \\\"that the king is offering the laws to the god; that the king is accepting or offering the emblems of sovereignty of the rod and ring; or most probably that these emblems are the measuring tools of the rod measure and rope measure used in temple building\\\".[52] hammurabi may even be imitating shamash.[53] it is certain, though, that the draughtsman showed hammurabi's close links to the divine realm,[54] using composition and iconography.[55] the prologue and epilogue together occupy one fifth of the text. out of around 4,130 lines, the prologue occupies 300 lines and the epilogue occupies 500.[15] they are in ring composition around the laws, though there is no visual break distinguishing them from the laws.[56] both are written in poetic style,[57] and, as william w. davies wrote, \\\"contain much ... which sounds very like braggadocio\\\".[58] the 300 line prologue begins with an etiology of hammurabi's royal authority (1 49). anum, the babylonian sky god and king of the gods, granted rulership over humanity to marduk. marduk chose the centre of his earthly power to be babylon, which in the real world worshipped him as its tutelary god. marduk established the office of kingship within babylon. finally, anum, along with the babylonian wind god enlil, chose hammurabi to be babylon's king. hammurabi was to rule \\\"to prevent the strong from oppressing the weak\\\" (37 39: dannum en\\u0161am ana l\\u0101 \\u1e2bab\\u0101lim). he was to rise like shamash over the mesopotamians (the \\u1e63alm\\u0101t qaqqadim, literally the \\\"black headed people\\\") and illuminate the land (40 44).[59][note 1] hammurabi then lists his achievements and virtues (50 291). these are expressed in noun form, in the akkadian first person singular nominal sentence construction \\\"[noun] ... an\\u0101ku\\\" (\\\"i am [noun]\\\").[60] the first nominal sentence (50 53) is short: \\\"i am hammurabi, the shepherd, selected by the god enlil\\\" (\\u1e2bammurabi r\\u0113'\\u00fbm nib\\u012bt enlil an\\u0101ku). then hammurabi continues for over 200 lines in a single nominal sentence with the an\\u0101ku delayed to the very end (291).[61][note 1] hammurabi repeatedly calls himself na'dum, \\\"pious\\\" (lines 61, 149, 241, and 272). the metaphor of hammurabi as his people's shepherd also recurs. it was a common metaphor for ancient near eastern kings, but is perhaps justified by hammurabi's interest in his subjects' affairs.[62] his affinities with many different gods are stressed throughout. he is portrayed as dutiful in restoring and maintaining temples and peerless on the battlefield. the list of his accomplishments has helped establish that the text was written late in hammurabi's reign. after the list, hammurabi explains that he fulfilled marduk's request to establish \\\"truth and justice\\\" (kittam u m\\u012b\\u0161aram) for the people (292 302), although the prologue never directly references the laws.[63] the prologue ends \\\"at that time:\\\" (303: in\\u016bmi\\u0161u) and the laws begin.[64][note 1] unlike the prologue, the 500 line epilogue is explicitly related to the laws.[63] the epilogue begins (3144' 3151'): \\\"these are the just decisions which hammurabi ... has established\\\" (d\\u012bn\\u0101t m\\u012b\\u0161arim \\u0161a \\u1e2bammurabi... ukinnu ma). he exalts his laws and his magnanimity (3152' 3239').[65] he then expresses a hope that \\\"any wronged man who has a lawsuit\\\" (aw\\u012blum \\u1e2bablum \\u0161a aw\\u0101tam ira\\u0161\\u0161\\u00fb) may have the laws of the stele read aloud to him and know his rights (3240' 3256').[66] this would bring hammurabi praise (3257' 3275') and divine favour (3276' 3295').[67] hammurabi wishes for good fortune for any ruler who heeds his pronouncements and respects his stele (3296' 3359').[68] however, he invokes the wrath of the gods on any man who disobeys or erases his pronouncements (3360' 3641', the end of the text).[69][note 1] the epilogue contains much legal imagery, and the phrase \\\"to prevent the strong from oppressing the weak\\\" (3202' 3203': dannum en\\u0161am ana l\\u0101 \\u1e2bab\\u0101lim)[70] is reused from the prologue. however, the king's main concern appears to be ensuring that his achievements are not forgotten and his name not sullied.[71] the list of curses heaped upon any future defacer is 281 lines long and extremely forceful. some of the curses are very vivid: \\\"may the god sin ... decree for him a life that is no better than death\\\" (3486' 3508': s\\u00een... bal\\u0101\\u1e6dam \\u0161a itti m\\u016btim \\u0161itannu ana \\u0161\\u012bmtim li\\u0161\\u012bm\\u0161um);[72] \\\"may he [the future defacer] conclude every day, month, and year of his reign with groaning and mourning\\\" (3497' 3501': \\u016bm\\u012b war\\u1e2b\\u012b \\u0161an\\u0101t pal\\u0113\\u0161u ina t\\u0101n\\u0113\\u1e2bim u dimmatim li\\u0161aqti);[72] may he experience \\\"the spilling of his life force like water\\\" (3435' 3436': tab\\u0101k napi\\u0161ti\\u0161u k\\u012bma m\\u00ea).[73] hammurabi implores a variety of gods individually to turn their particular attributes against the defacer. for example: \\\"may the [storm] god adad ... deprive him of the benefits of rain from heaven and flood from the springs\\\" (3509' 3515': adad... zunn\\u012b ina \\u0161am\\u00ea m\\u012blam ina nagbim l\\u012b\\u1e6der\\u0161u);[72] \\\"may the god [of wisdom] ea ... deprive him of all understanding and wisdom, and may he lead him into confusion\\\" (3440' 3451': ea... uznam u n\\u0113meqam l\\u012b\\u1e6der\\u0161u ma ina m\\u012b\\u0161\\u012btim littarr\\u016b\\u0161u).[73][note 1] gods and goddesses are invoked in this order:[69] the code of hammurabi is the longest and best organised legal text from the ancient near east,[74] as well as the best preserved.[75] the classification below (columns 1 3) is driver & miles',[76] with several amendments, and roth's translation is used.[77] laws represented by letters are those reconstructed primarily from documents other than the louvre stele. . (250)[85] the purpose and legal authority of the code have been disputed since the mid 20th century.[87] theories fall into three main categories: that it is legislation, whether a code of law or a body of statutes; that it is a sort of law report, containing records of past cases and judgments; and that it is an abstract work of jurisprudence. the jurisprudence theory has gained much support within assyriology.[88] the term \\\"code\\\" presupposes that the document was intended to be enforced as legislation. it was used by scheil in his editio princeps,[89] and widely adopted afterwards. c. h. w. johns, one of the most prolific early commentators on the document, proclaimed that \\\"the code well deserves its name\\\".[40] recent assyriologists have used the term without comment,[90] as well as scholars outside assyriology.[91] however, only if the text was intended as enforced legislation can it truly be called a code of law and its provisions laws. the document, on first inspection, resembles a highly organised code similar to the code of justinian and the napoleonic code.[92] there is also evidence that d\\u012bn\\u0101tum, which in the code of hammurabi sometimes denote individual \\\"laws\\\", were enforced.[93] one copy of the code calls it a \\u1e63imdat \\u0161arrim, \\\"royal decree\\\", which denotes a kind of enforced legislation.[94] however, the arguments against this view are strong. firstly, it would make a very unusual code reuven yaron called the designation \\\"code\\\" a \\\"persistent misnomer\\\".[95] vital areas of society and commerce are omitted.[96] for example, marc van de mieroop observes that the code \\\"deals with cattle and agricultural fields, but it almost entirely ignores the work of shepherds, vital to babylonia's economy\\\".[97] then, against the legislation theory more generally, highly implausible circumstances are covered, such as threshing with goats, animals far too unruly for the task (law 270).[98] the laws are also strictly casuistic (\\\"if ... then\\\"); unlike in the mosaic law, there are no apodictic laws (general commands). these would more obviously suggest prescriptive legislation. the strongest argument against the legislation theory, however, is that most judges appear to have paid the code no attention. this line of criticism originated with benno landsberger in 1950.[87] no mesopotamian legal document explicitly references the code or any other law collection,[92] despite the great scale of the corpus.[99] two references to prescriptions on \\\"a stele\\\" (nar\\u00fb)[100] come closest. in contrast, numerous judgments cite royal m\\u012b\\u0161arum decrees.[92] raymond westbrook held that this strengthened the argument from silence that ancient near eastern legal \\\"codes\\\" had legal import.[101] furthermore, many old babylonian judgments run entirely counter to the code's prescriptions.[102] a second theory is that the code is a sort of law report, and as such contains records of past cases and judgments, albeit phrased abstractly. this would provide one explanation for the casuistic format of the \\\"laws\\\"; indeed, jean bott\\u00e9ro believed he had found a record of a case that inspired one.[103] however, such finds are inconclusive and very rare, despite the scale of the mesopotamian legal corpus.[104] furthermore, legal judgments were frequently recorded in mesopotamia, and they recount the facts of the case without generalising them.[105] these judgments were concerned almost exclusively with points of fact, prompting martha roth to comment: \\\"i know of only one case out of thousands extant that might be said to revolve around a point of law\\\".[106] a third theory, which has gained traction within assyriology, is that the code is not a true code but an abstract treatise on how judgments should be formulated. this led fritz rudolf kraus, in an early formulation of the theory, to call it jurisprudence (rechtsspr\\u00fcche).[107] kraus proposed that it was a work of mesopotamian scholarship in the same category as omen collections like \\u0161umma \\u0101lu and ana itti\\u0161u.[107] others have provided their own versions of this theory.[108] a. leo oppenheim remarked that the code of hammurabi and similar mesopotamian law collections \\\"represent an interesting formulation of social criticism and should not be taken as normative directions\\\".[109] this interpretation bypasses the problem of low congruence between the code and actual legal judgments. secondly, the code does bear striking similarities to other works of mesopotamian scholarship. key points of similarity are the list format and the order of the items,[110] which ann guinan describes as a complex \\\"serial logic\\\".[111] marc van de mieroop explains that, in common with other works of mesopotamian scholarship such as omen lists, king lists, and god lists, the entries of the code of hammurabi are arranged according to two principles. these are \\\"opposition\\\" whereby a variable in one entry is altered to make another entry and \\\"pointillism\\\" whereby new conditions are added to an entry, or paradigmatic series pursued, to generate a sequence.[112] van de mieroop provides the following examples: if a physician performs major surgery with a bronze lancet upon an [aw\\u012blum] and thus heals the [aw\\u012blum], or opens an [aw\\u012blum]'s temple with a bronze lancet and thus heals the [aw\\u012blum]'s eye, he shall take ten shekels of silver (as his fee). if a physician performs major surgery with a bronze lancet upon an [aw\\u012blum] and thus causes the [aw\\u012blum]'s death, or opens an [aw\\u012blum]'s temple with a bronze lancet and thus blinds the [aw\\u012blum]'s eye, they shall cut off his hand. laws 215 and 218 illustrate the principle of opposition: one variable of the first law, the outcome of the operations, is altered to create the second.[114] if there is either a soldier or [an auxiliary] who is taken captive while serving in a royal fortress [...] if he should [...] return and get back to his city, they shall return to him his field and orchard and he himself shall perform his service obligation. if there is either a soldier or [an auxiliary] who is taken captive in a royal fortress, and his son is able to perform the service obligation, the field and orchard shall be given to him, and he shall perform his father's service obligation. if his son is young and is unable to perform his father's service obligation, one third of the field and orchard shall be given to his mother, and his mother shall raise him. here, following the principle of pointillism, circumstances are added to the first entry to create more entries.[116] pointillism also lets list entries be generated by following paradigmatic series common to multiple branches of scholarship. it can thus explain the implausible entries. for example, in the case of the goat used for threshing (law 270),[117] the previous laws concern other animals that were used for threshing. the established series of domesticated beasts dictated that a goat come next.[118] wolfram von soden, who decades earlier called this way of thinking listenwissenschaft (\\\"list science\\\"),[119] often denigrated it.[120] however, more recent writers, such as marc van de mieroop, jean bott\\u00e9ro, and ann guinan, have either avoided value judgments or expressed admiration. lists were central to mesopotamian science and logic, and their distinctive structural principles let entries be generated infinitely.[118] linking the code to the scribal tradition within which \\\"list science\\\" emerged also explains why trainee scribes copied and studied it for over a millennium.[23] the code appears in a late babylonian (7th 6th century bc) list of literary and scholarly texts.[121] no other law collection became so entrenched in the curriculum.[122] rather than a code of laws, then, it may be a scholarly treatise.[100] much has been written on what the code suggests about old babylonian society and its legal system.[failed verification] for example, whether it demonstrates that there were no professional advocates,[123] or that there were professional judges.[124] scholars who approach the code as a self contained document renounce such claims.[125] one principle widely accepted to underlie the code is lex talionis, or \\\"eye for an eye\\\". laws 196 and 200 respectively prescribe an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth when one man destroys another's. punishments determined by lex talionis could be transferred to the sons of the wrongdoer.[123] for example, law 229 states that the death of a homeowner in a house collapse necessitates the death of the house's builder. the following law 230 states that if the homeowner's son died, the builder's son must die also.[84] persons were not equal before the law; not just age and profession but also class and gender dictated the punishment or remedy they received. three main kinds of person, aw\\u012blum, mu\\u0161k\\u0113num, and wardum (male)/amtum (female), are mentioned throughout the code. a wardum/amtum was a male/female slave. as for aw\\u012blum and mu\\u0161k\\u0113num, though contentious, it seems likely that the difference was one of social class, with aw\\u012blum meaning something like \\\"gentleman\\\" and mu\\u0161k\\u0113num something like \\\"commoner\\\".[126] the penalties were not necessarily stricter for a mu\\u0161k\\u0113num than an aw\\u012blum: a mu\\u0161k\\u0113num's life may have been cheaper, but so were some of his fines.[127] there was also inequality within these classes: laws 200 and 202, for example, show that one aw\\u012blum could be of higher rank than another.[128] the above principles are distant in spirit from modern systems of common and civil law, but some may be more familiar. one such principle is the presumption of innocence; the first two laws of the stele prescribe punishments, determined by lex talionis, for unsubstantiated accusations. written evidence was valued highly,[129] especially in matters of contract.[42] one crime was given only one punishment.[130] the laws also recognized the importance of the intentions of a defendant.[123] lastly, the code's establishment on public stelae was supposedly intended to increase access to justice. whether or not this was true, suggesting that a wronged man have the stele read aloud to him (lines 3240' 3254')[note 1] is a concrete measure in this direction, given the inaccessibility of scribal education in the old babylonian period.[131] the prologue asserts that hammurabi was chosen by the gods. raymond westbrook observed that in ancient near eastern law, \\\"the king was the primary source of legislation\\\".[132] however, they could delegate their god given legal authority to judges.[133] however, as owen b. jenkins observed, the prescriptions themselves bear \\\"an astonishing absence ... of all theological or even ceremonial law\\\".[45] the laws are written in the old babylonian dialect of akkadian. their style is regular and repetitive, and today they are a standard set text for introductory akkadian classes.[134] however, as a. leo oppenheim summarises, the cuneiform signs themselves are \\\"vertically arranged ... within boxes placed in bands side by side from right to left\\\", an arrangement already antiquated by hammurabi's time.[135] the laws are expressed in casuistic format: they are conditional sentences with the case detailed in the protasis (\\\"if\\\" clause) and the remedy given in the apodosis (\\\"then\\\" clause). the protasis begins \\u0161umma, \\\"if\\\",[136] except when it adds to circumstances already specified in a previous law (e.g. laws 36, 38, and 40).[137] the preterite is used for simple past verbs in the protasis, or possibly for a simple conditional.[136] the perfect often appears at the end of the protasis after one or more preterites to convey sequence of action, or possibly a hypothetical conditional.[136] the durative, sometimes called the \\\"present\\\" in assyriology, may express intention in the laws.[136] for ease of english reading, some translations give preterite and perfect verbs in the protasis a present sense.[138] in the apodosis, the verbs are in the durative, though the sense varies between permissive \\\"it is permitted that x happen\\\" and instructive \\\"x must/will happen\\\".[139] in both protasis and apodosis, sequence of action is conveyed by suffixing verbs with  ma, \\\"and\\\".[140]  ma can also have the sense \\\"but\\\".[141] the code is relatively well understood, but some items of its vocabulary are controversial.[vague] as mentioned, the terms aw\\u012blum and mu\\u0161k\\u0113num have proved difficult to translate. they probably denote respectively a male member of a higher and lower social class.[142] wolfram von soden, in his akkadisches handw\\u00f6rterbuch, proposed that mu\\u0161k\\u0113num was derived from \\u0161uk\\u00eanum, \\\"to bow down/supplicate\\\".[143] as a word for a man of low social standing, it has endured, possibly from a sumerian root, into arabic (misk\\u012bn), italian (meschino), spanish (mezquino), and french (mesquin).[144] however, some earlier translators, also seeking to explain the mu\\u0161k\\u0113num's special treatment, translated it as \\\"leper\\\" and even \\\"noble\\\".[145] some translators have supplied stilted readings for aw\\u012blum, such as \\\"seignior\\\",[146] \\\"elite man\\\",[147] and \\\"member of the aristocracy\\\";[148] others have left it untranslated.[149] certain legal terms have also proved difficult to translate. for example, d\\u012bnum and d\\u012bttum can denote the law in general as well as individual laws, verdicts, divine pronouncements and other phenomena.[150] m\\u012b\\u0161arum can likewise denote the law in general as well as a kind of royal decree.[151] the code of hammurabi bears strong similarities to earlier mesopotamian law collections. many purport to have been written by rulers, and this tradition was probably widespread.[10] earlier law collections express their god given legitimacy similarly.[152] like the code of hammurabi, they feature prologues and epilogues: the code of ur nammu has a prologue, the code of lipit ishtar a prologue and an epilogue, and the laws of eshnunna an epilogue. also, like the code of hammurabi, they uphold the \\\"one crime, one punishment\\\" principle.[153] the cases covered and language used are, overall, strikingly similar.[10] scribes were still copying earlier law collections, such as the code of ur nammu, when hammurabi produced his own code.[154] this suggests that earlier collections may have not only resembled the code but influenced it. raymond westbrook maintained that there was a fairly consistent tradition of \\\"ancient near eastern law\\\" which included the code of hammurabi,[155] and that this was largely customary law.[156] nonetheless, there are differences: for example, stephen bertman has suggested that where earlier collections are concerned with compensating victims, the code is concerned with physically punishing offenders.[157] additionally, the above conclusions of similarity and influence apply only to the law collections themselves. the actual legal practices from the context of each code are mysterious.[158] the code of hammurabi also bears strong similarities to later mesopotamian law collections: to the casuistic middle assyrian laws and to the neo babylonian laws,[159] whose format is largely relative (\\\"a man who ...\\\"). it is easier to posit direct influence for these later collections, given the code's survival through the scribal curriculum.[23] lastly, although influence is more difficult to trace, there is evidence that the hittite laws may have been part of the same tradition of legal writing outside mesopotamia proper.[160] the relationship of the code of hammurabi to the mosaic law, specifically the covenant code of exodus 20:22 23:19, has been a subject of discussion since its discovery.[46] friedrich delitzsch argued the case for strong influence in a 1902 lecture, in one episode of the \\\"babel und bibel\\\" (\\\"babel and bible\\\", or \\\"panbabylonism\\\") debate on the influence of ancient mesopotamian cultures on ancient israel. however, he was met with strong resistance.[161] there was cultural contact between mesopotamia and the levant, and middle bronze age tablets of casuistic cuneiform law have been found at hazor.[162] there are also similarities between the code of hamurabi and the covenant code: in the casuistic format, in principles such as lex talionis (\\\"eye for an eye\\\"), and in the content of the provisions. some similarities are striking, such as in the provisions concerning a man goring ox (code of hammurabi laws 250 252,[85] exodus 21:28 32).[163] certain writers have posited direct influence: david p. wright, for example, asserts that the covenant code is \\\"directly, primarily, and throughout dependent upon the laws of hammurabi\\\", \\\"a creative rewriting of mesopotamian sources ... to be viewed as an academic abstraction rather than a digest of laws\\\".[164] others[who?] posit indirect influence, such as via aramaic or phoenician intermediaries.[165] the consensus, however, is that the similarities are a result of inheriting common traditions.[166] in 1916, george a. barton cited \\\"a similarity of antecedents and of general intellectual outlook\\\".[167] more recently, david winton thomas has stated: \\\"there is no ground for assuming any direct borrowing by the hebrew from the babylonian. even where the two sets of laws differ little in the letter, they differ much in the spirit\\\".[168] the influence of the code of hammurabi on later law collections is difficult to establish. marc van de mieroop suggests that it may have influenced the greek gortyn code and the roman twelve tables.[169] however, even van de mieroop acknowledges that most roman law is not similar to the code, or likely to have been influenced by it.[170] knowing the code's influence on modern law requires knowing its influence on mosaic and graeco roman law. since this is contentious, commentators have restricted themselves to observing similarities and differences between the code and, e.g., united states law and medieval law.[171] some[who?] have remarked that the punishments found in the code are no more severe, and, in some cases, less so.[172][needs update] law 238 stipulates that a sea captain, ship manager, or ship charterer that saved a ship from total loss was only required to pay one half the value of the ship to the ship owner.[173][174][175] in the digesta seu pandectae (533), the second volume of the codification of laws ordered by justinian i (527 565) of the eastern roman empire, a legal opinion written by the roman jurist paulus at the beginning of the crisis of the third century in 235 ad was included about the lex rhodia (\\\"rhodian law\\\") that articulates the general average principle of marine insurance established on the island of rhodes in approximately 1000 to 800 bc as a member of the doric hexapolis, plausibly by the phoenicians during the proposed dorian invasion and emergence of the purported sea peoples during the greek dark ages (c. 1100   c. 750) that led to the proliferation of the doric greek dialect.[176][177][178] the law of general average constitutes the fundamental principle that underlies all insurance.[177][better source needed] the code is often referred to in legal scholarship, where its provisions are assumed to be laws, and the document is assumed to be a true code of laws. this is also true outside academia.[179][original research?] there is a relief portrait of hammurabi over the doors to the house chamber of the u.s. capitol, along with portraits of 22 others \\\"noted for their work in establishing the principles that underlie american law\\\".[180] there are replicas of the louvre stele in institutions around the world,[citation needed] including the headquarters of the united nations in new york city[181] and the peace palace in the hague (seat of the international court of justice).[182] hammurabi's code is notable for its comprehensive approach to law, covering subjects from criminal acts to medical practices. the code includes specific rules that regulate medical treatments, set surgery fees, and punish malpractice. for instance, if a physician caused the death of a noble during surgery, they would be severely punished, sometimes having their hand cut off. this harshness portrays how seriously medical responsibility was taken even in ancient times. from a political science perspective, hammurabi's code is valuable and fundamental because it demonstrates how law was used to reinforce social hierarchies and maintain control. pearn (2016) writes that the code's laws were applied differently depending on a person's social class, so nobles received greater protection than commoners and enslaved people. this legal stratification reflects the power dynamic of babylonian society and shows how law was used not just to govern but also to preserve the social order.[183] finally, the hammurabi's code could be considered impressive by its power (despite its modern irrelevancy) and severity. the harsh punishments may seem extreme by modern standards, but they were likely necessary to maintain order in a society where survival depended on strict adherence to rules. at the same time, hammurabi's code represents a significant step forward in the development of law, medicine and the medico legal system. by codifying laws and making them public, hammurabi established a system that would influence generations so that the principles of justice, fairness, and accountability that underpin the code continue to resonate today.\\n\\nheraclitus (/\\u02cch\\u025br\\u0259\\u02c8kla\\u026at\\u0259s/; ancient greek: \\u1f21\\u03c1\\u03ac\\u03ba\\u03bb\\u03b5\\u03b9\\u03c4\\u03bf\\u03c2 h\\u0113r\\u00e1kleitos; fl. c. 500 bc) was an ancient greek pre socratic philosopher from the city of ephesus, which was then part of the persian empire. he exerts a wide influence on ancient and modern western philosophy, through the works of such authors as plato, aristotle, hegel, marx and heidegger. little is known of heraclitus's life. he wrote a single work, only fragments of which have survived. even in ancient times, his paradoxical philosophy, appreciation for wordplay, and cryptic, oracular epigrams earned him the epithets \\\"the dark\\\" and \\\"the obscure\\\". he was considered arrogant and depressed, a misanthrope who was subject to melancholia. consequently, he became known as \\\"the weeping philosopher\\\" in contrast to the ancient atomist philosopher democritus, who was known as \\\"the laughing philosopher\\\". the central ideas of heraclitus's philosophy are the unity of opposites and the concept of change. heraclitus saw harmony and justice in strife. he viewed the world as constantly in flux, always \\\"becoming\\\" but never \\\"being\\\". he expressed this in sayings like \\\"everything flows\\\" (greek: \\u03c0\\u03ac\\u03bd\\u03c4\\u03b1 \\u03c1\\u03b5\\u03b9, panta rhei) and \\\"no man ever steps in the same river twice\\\". this insistence upon change contrasts with that of the ancient philosopher parmenides, who believed in a reality of static \\\"being\\\". heraclitus believed fire was the arche, the fundamental stuff of the world. in choosing an arche heraclitus followed the milesians before him   thales with water, anaximander with apeiron (lit. boundless or infinite), and anaximenes with air. heraclitus also thought the logos (lit. word, discourse, or reason) gave structure to the world. heraclitus, the son of blyson, was from the ionian city of ephesus, a port on the cayster river, on the western coast of asia minor (modern day turkey). in the 6th century bc, ephesus, like other cities in ionia, lived under the effects of both the rise of lydia under croesus and his overthrow by cyrus the great c. 547 bc.[1] ephesus appears to have subsequently cultivated a close relationship with the persian empire; during the suppression of the ionian revolt by darius the great in 494 bc, ephesus was spared and emerged as the dominant greek city in ionia.[1] miletus, the home to the previous philosophers, was captured and sacked.[2] the main source for the life of heraclitus is the doxographer diogenes la\\u00ebrtius.[a] although most of the information provided by laertius is unreliable, and the ancient stories about heraclitus are thought to be later fabrications based on interpretations of the preserved fragments; the anecdote that heraclitus relinquished the hereditary title of \\\"king\\\" to his younger brother may at least imply that heraclitus was from an aristocratic family in ephesus.[1][note 1] heraclitus appears to have had little sympathy for democracy or the masses.[d][e] however, it is unclear whether he was \\\"an unconditional partisan of the rich\\\", or if, like the sage solon, he was \\\"withdrawn from competing factions\\\".[1] since antiquity, heraclitus has been labeled a solitary figure and an arrogant misanthrope.[5][a] the skeptic timon of phlius called heraclitus a \\\"mob abuser\\\" (ochloloidoros).[a] heraclitus considered himself self taught.[f] he criticized fools for being \\\"put in a flutter by every word\\\".[g] he did not consider others incapable, but unwilling: \\\"and though reason is common, most people live as though they had an understanding peculiar to themselves.\\\"[h] heraclitus did not seem to like the prevailing religion of the time, criticizing the popular mystery cults, blood sacrifice, and prayer to statues.[6][i][j][k][note 2] he also did not believe in funeral rites, saying \\\"corpses are more fit to be cast out than dung.\\\"[9][l] he further criticized homer,[m][n] hesiod,[o] pythagoras,[p] xenophanes, and hecataeus.[a][q] he endorsed the sage bias of priene, who is quoted as saying \\\"most men are bad\\\".[r] he praised a man named hermodorus as the best among the ephesians, who he says should all kill themselves for exiling him.[s][t][note 3] heraclitus is traditionally considered to have flourished in the 69th olympiad (504 501 bc),[11][a] but this date may simply be based on a prior account synchronizing his life with the reign of darius the great.[1][note 4] however, this date can be considered \\\"roughly accurate\\\" based on a fragment that references pythagoras, xenophanes, and hecataeus as older contemporaries, placing him near the end of the sixth century bc.[1][13][14] according to diogenes laertius, heraclitus died covered in dung after failing to cure himself from dropsy. this may be to parody his doctrine that for souls it is death to become water, and that a dry soul is best.[15][16][u][v][w] heraclitus is said to have produced a single work on papyrus,[a] which has not survived; however, over 100 fragments of this work survive in quotations by other authors.[note 5] the title is unknown,[19] but many later writers refer to this work, and works by other pre socratics, as on nature.[20][21][a] according to diogenes la\\u00ebrtius, heraclitus deposited the book in the artemision   one of the seven wonders of the ancient world   as a dedication.[a] classicist charles kahn states: \\\"down to the time of plutarch and clement, if not later, the little book of heraclitus was available in its original form to any reader who chose to seek it out.\\\"[22] yet, by the time of simplicius of cilicia, a 6th century neoplatonic philosopher, who mentions heraclitus 32 times but never quotes from him, heraclitus's work was so rare that it was unavailable even to simplicius and the other scholars at the platonic academy in athens.[23] diogenes la\\u00ebrtius wrote that the book was divided into three parts: the universe, politics, and theology,[a] but, classicists have challenged that division. classicist john burnet has argued that \\\"it is not to be supposed that this division is due to [heraclitus] himself; all we can infer is that the work fell naturally into these parts when the stoic commentators took their editions of it in hand\\\".[24] the stoics divided their own philosophy into three parts: ethics, logic, and physics.[25] the stoic cleanthes further divided philosophy into dialectics, rhetoric, ethics, politics, physics, and theology, and philologist karl deichgr\\u00e4ber has argued the last three are the same as the alleged division of heraclitus.[26] the philosopher paul schuster has argued the division came from the pinakes.[27][28] scholar martin litchfield west claims that while the existing fragments do not give much of an idea of the overall structure,[29] the beginning of the discourse can probably be determined,[note 6] starting with the opening lines, which are quoted by sextus empiricus: of the logos being forever do men prove to be uncomprehending, both before they hear and once they have heard it. for although all things happen according to this logos they are like the unexperienced experiencing words and deeds such as i explain when i distinguish each thing according to its nature and declare how it is. other men are unaware of what they do when they are awake just as they are forgetful of what they do when they are asleep.[x] heraclitus's style has been compared to a sibyl,[3][30][31] who \\\"with raving lips uttering things mirthless, unbedizened, and unperfumed, reaches over a thousand years with her voice, thanks to the god in her\\\".[y][note 7] kahn characterized the main features of heraclitus's writing as \\\"linguistic density\\\", meaning that single words and phrases have multiple meanings, and \\\"resonance\\\", meaning that expressions evoke one another.[33] heraclitus used literary devices like alliteration and chiasmus.[34] aristotle quotes part of the opening line of heraclitus's work in the rhetoric to outline the difficulty in punctuating heraclitus without ambiguity; he debated whether \\\"forever\\\" applied to \\\"being\\\" or to \\\"prove\\\".[34][z] aristotle's successor at the lyceum theophrastus says about heraclitus that \\\"some parts of his work [are] half finished, while other parts [made] a strange medley\\\".[a] theophrastus thought an inability to finish the work showed heraclitus was melancholic.[a] diogenes la\\u00ebrtius relays the story that the playwright euripides gave socrates a copy of heraclitus's work and asked for his opinion. socrates replied: \\\"the part i understand is excellent, and so too is, i dare say, the part i do not understand; but it needs a delian diver to get to the bottom of it.\\\"[35] also according to diogenes la\\u00ebrtius, timon of phlius called heraclitus \\\"the riddler\\\" (\\u03b1\\u1f30\\u03bd\\u03b9\\u03ba\\u03c4\\u03ae\\u03c2; ainikt\\u0113s) a likely reference to an alleged similarity to pythagorean riddles.[36] timon said heraclitus wrote his book \\\"rather unclearly\\\" (\\u03b1\\u03c3\\u03b1\\u03c6\\u03b5\\u03c3\\u03c4\\u03b5\\u03c1\\u03bf\\u03bd; asaphesteron); according to timon, this was intended to allow only the \\\"capable\\\" to attempt it.[a] by the time of cicero, this epithet became in greek \\\"the dark\\\" (\\u1f41 \\u03c3\\u03ba\\u03bf\\u03c4\\u03b5\\u03b9\\u03bd\\u03cc\\u03c2; ho skotein\\u00f3s) or in latin \\\"the obscure\\\" as he had spoken nimis obscur\\u0113 (\\\"too obscurely\\\") concerning nature and had done so deliberately in order to be misunderstood.[37][38] the obscurity was \\\"probably with the idea that it is for us to seek within ourselves, as he sought for himself and found\\\".[39][f] heraclitus seemed to pattern his obscurity after oracles.[40] heraclitus did state \\\"nature loves to hide\\\"[aa] and \\\"a hidden connection is stronger than an obvious one\\\".[ab] he also stated \\\"the lord whose oracle is in delphi neither speaks nor conceals, but gives a sign.\\\"[41][ac] heraclitus is the earliest known literary reference to the delphic maxim to know thyself.[42][ad] heraclitus has been the subject of numerous interpretations. according to scholar daniel w. graham, heraclitus has been seen as a \\\"material monist or a process philosopher; a scientific cosmologist, a metaphysician and a religious thinker; an empiricist, a rationalist, a mystic; a conventional thinker and a revolutionary; a developer of logic   one who denied the law of non contradiction; the first genuine philosopher and an anti intellectual obscurantist\\\".[43] the hallmarks of heraclitus's philosophy are the unity of opposites and change, or flux.[44][45] according to aristotle, heraclitus was a dialetheist, or one who denies the law of noncontradiction (a law of thought or logical principle which states that something cannot be true and false at the same time).[46][47][ae] also according to aristotle, heraclitus was a materialist.[48] attempting to follow aristotle's hylomorphic interpretation, scholar w. k. c. guthrie interprets the distinction between flux and stability as one between matter and form. on this view, heraclitus is a flux theorist because he is a materialist who believes matter always changes.[49] there are no unchanging forms like with plato or aristotle. as one author puts it, \\\"plato took flux as the greatest warning against materialism\\\".[50] several fragments seem to relate to the unity of opposites.[45] for example: \\\"the straight and the crooked path of the fuller's comb is one and the same\\\";[af] \\\"the way up is the way down\\\";[ag] \\\"beginning and end, on a circle's circumference, are common\\\";[ah] and \\\"thou shouldst unite things whole and things not whole, that which tends to unite and that which tends to separate, the harmonious and the discordant; from all things arises the one, and from the one all things.\\\"[ai] over time, the opposites change into each other:[51][52] \\\"mortals are immortals and immortals are mortals, the one living the others' death and dying the others' life\\\";[aj] \\\"as the same thing in us is living and dead, waking and sleeping, young and old. for these things having changed around are those, and those in turn having changed around are these\\\";[ak] and \\\"cold things warm up, the hot cools off, wet becomes dry, dry becomes wet.\\\"[al] it also seems they change into each other depending on one's point of view, a case of relativism or perspectivism.[53][54] heraclitus states: \\\"disease makes health sweet and good; hunger, satiety; toil, rest.\\\"[am] while men drink and wash with water, fish prefer to drink saltwater, pigs prefer to wash in mud, and fowls prefer to wash in dust.[an][ao][ap] \\\"oxen are happy when they find bitter vetches to eat\\\"[aq] and \\\"asses would rather have refuse than gold.\\\"[ar] diogenes la\\u00ebrtius summarizes heraclitus's philosophy as follows: \\\"all things come into being by conflict of opposites, and the sum of things (\\u03c4\\u1f70 \\u1f45\\u03bb\\u03b1 ta hola ('the whole')) flows like a stream.\\\"[a] classicist jonathan barnes states that \\\"panta rhei, 'everything flows' is probably the most familiar of heraclitus's sayings, yet few modern scholars think he said it\\\".[55] barnes observes that although the exact phrase was not ascribed to heraclitus until the 6th century by simplicius, a similar saying expressing the same idea,[55] panta chorei, or \\\"everything moves\\\" is ascribed to heraclitus by plato in the cratylus.[as] since plato, heraclitus's theory of flux has been associated with the metaphor of a flowing river, which cannot be stepped into twice.[56][as] this fragment from heraclitus's writings has survived in three different forms:[55] the classicist karl reinhardt identified the first river quote as the genuine one.[57] the river fragments (especially the second \\\"we both are and are not\\\") seem to suggest not only is the river constantly changing, but we do as well, perhaps commenting on existential questions about humanity and personhood.[58] scholars such as reinhardt also interpreted the metaphor as illustrating what is stable, rather than the usual interpretation of illustrating change.[59] classicist karl martin dietz [de] has said: \\\"you will not find anything, in which the river remains constant ... just the fact, that there is a particular river bed, that there is a source and an estuary etc. is something, that stays identical. and this is ... the concept of a river.\\\"[60] according to american philosopher w. v. o. quine, the river parable illustrates that the river is a process through time. one cannot step twice into the same river stage.[61] professor m. m. mccabe has argued that the three statements on rivers should all be read as fragments from a discourse. mccabe suggests reading them as though they arose in succession. the three fragments \\\"could be retained, and arranged in an argumentative sequence\\\".[17] in mccabe's reading of the fragments, heraclitus can be read as a philosopher capable of sustained argument, rather than just aphorism.[17] heraclitus said \\\"strife is justice\\\"[aw] and \\\"all things take place by strife\\\".[ax] he called the opposites in conflict \\u1f14\\u03c1\\u03b9\\u03c2 (eris), \\\"strife\\\", and theorized that the apparently unitary state, \\u03b4\\u03af\\u03ba\\u03b7 (dik\\u00ea), \\\"justice\\\", results in \\\"the most beautiful harmony\\\",[ax] in contrast to anaximander, who described the same as injustice.[31][62][63] aristotle said heraclitus disagreed with homer because homer wished that strife would leave the world, which according to heraclitus would destroy the world; \\\"there would be no harmony without high and low notes, and no animals without male and female, which are opposites\\\".[ay] it may also explain why he disagreed with the pythagorean emphasis on harmony, but not on strife.[49] heraclitus suggests that the world and its various parts are kept together through the tension produced by the unity of opposites, like the string of a bow or a lyre.[64][az] on one account, this is the earliest use of the concept of force.[65] a quote about the bow shows his appreciation for wordplay: \\\"the bow's name is life, but its work is death.\\\"[ba][note 8] each substance contains its opposite, making for a continual circular exchange of generation, destruction, and motion that results in the stability of the world.[66][67] this can be illustrated by the quote \\\"even the kykeon separates if it is not stirred.\\\"[bb] according to abraham schoener: \\\"war is the central principle in heraclitus' thought.\\\"[68] another of heraclitus's famous sayings highlights the idea that the unity of opposites is also a conflict of opposites: \\\"war is father of all and king of all; and some he manifested as gods, some as men; some he made slaves, some free\\\";[bc] war is a creative tension that brings things into existence.[66][69] heraclitus says further \\\"gods and men honour those slain in war\\\";[bd] \\\"greater deaths gain greater portions\\\";[be] and \\\"every beast is tended by blows.\\\"[bf] a core concept for heraclitus is logos, an ancient greek word literally meaning \\\"word, speech, discourse, or meaning\\\". for heraclitus, the logos seems to designate the rational structure or ordered composition of the world.[70][71] as well as the opening quote of his book, one fragment reads: \\\"listening not to me but to the logos, it is wise to agree (homologein) that all things are one.\\\"[bg] another fragment reads: \\\"[hoi polloi] ... do not know how to listen [to logos] or how to speak [the truth].\\\"[72][bh] the word logos has a wide variety of other uses, such that heraclitus might have a different meaning of the word for each usage in his book. kahn has argued that heraclitus used the word in multiple senses,[73] whereas guthrie has argued that there is no evidence heraclitus used it in a way that was significantly different from that in which it was used by contemporaneous speakers of greek.[74] professor michael stokes interprets heraclitus's use of logos as a public fact like a proposition or formula; like guthrie, he views heraclitus as a materialist, so he grants heraclitus would not have considered these as abstract objects or immaterial things.[62][75] another possibility is the logos referred to the truth, or to the book itself.[76][77][78] classicist walther kranz translated it as \\\"sense\\\".[77] heraclitus's logos doctrine may also be the origin of the doctrine of natural law.[79][80] heraclitus stated \\\"people ought to fight to keep their law as to defend the city walls. for all human laws get nourishment from the one divine law.\\\"[bi] \\\"far from arguing like the latter sophists, that the human law, because it is a conventional law, deserves to be abandoned in favor of the law of nature, herakleitos argued that the human law partakes of the law of nature, which is at the same time a divine law.\\\"[81] the milesians before heraclitus had a view called material monism which conceived of certain elements as the arche   thales with water, anaximander with apeiron, and anaximenes with air. since antiquity, philosophers have concluded that heraclitus construed of fire as the arche, the ultimate reality or the fundamental element that gave rise to the other elements.[82][bj][bk] pre socratic scholar eduard zeller has argued that heraclitus believed that heat in general and dry exhalation in particular, rather than visible fire, was the arche.[83] in one fragment, heraclitus writes: this world order (kosmos), the same for all, no god nor man did create, but it ever was and is and will be: ever living fire, kindling in measures and being quenched in measures.[bl] this is the oldest extant quote using kosmos, or order, to mean the world.[84][85] heraclitus seems to say fire is the one thing eternal in the universe.[86] from fire all things originate and all things return again in a process of never ending cycles.[86] plato and aristotle attribute to heraclitus a periodic destruction of the world by a great conflagration, known as ekpyrosis, which happens every great year   according to plato, every 36,000 years.[87] heraclitus more than once describes the transformations to and from fire: fire lives the death of earth, and air lives the death of fire; water lives the death of air, and earth that of water.[bm] the turnings of fire: first sea, and of sea half is earth, half fireburst. [earth] is liquefied as sea and measured into the same proportion as it had before it became earth.[bn] however, it is also argued by many that heraclitus never identified fire as the arche; rather, he only used fire to explain his notion of flux, as the basic stuff which changes or moves the most.[88] others conclude he used it as the physical form of logos.[89] on yet another interpretation, heraclitus is not a material monist explicating flux nor stability, but a revolutionary process philosopher who chooses fire in an attempt to say there is no arche. fire is a symbol or metaphor for change, rather than the basic stuff which changes the most.[90] perspectives of this sort emphasize his statements on change such as \\\"the way up is the way down\\\",[91][ag] as well as the quote \\\"all things are an exchange for fire, and fire for all things, even as wares for gold and gold for wares\\\",[bo] which has been understood as stating that while all can be transformed into fire, not everything comes from fire, just as not everything comes from gold.[92] while considered an ancient cosmologist,[93] heraclitus did not seem as interested in astronomy, meteorology, or mathematics as his predecessors.[94][95] it is surmised heraclitus believed that the earth was flat and extended infinitely in all directions.[96] heraclitus held all things occur according to fate.[97][bk] he said \\\"time (aion) is a child playing draughts, the kingly power is a child's.\\\"[b] it is disputed whether this means time and life is determined by rules like a game, by conflict like a game, or by arbitrary whims of the gods like a child plays.[98] similar to his views on rivers, heraclitus believed \\\"the sun is new each day.\\\"[99][bp] he also said the sun never sets.[100][bq] according to bertrand russell, this was \\\"obviously inspired by scientific reflection, and no doubt seemed to him to obviate the difficulty of understanding how the sun can work its way underground from west to east during the night\\\".[101] the physician galen explains: \\\"heraclitus says that the sun is a burning mass, kindled at its rising, and quenched at its setting.\\\"[102][103][104] heraclitus also believed that the sun is as large as it looks,[96][note 9] and said hesiod \\\"did not know night and day, for they are one.\\\"[bs] however, he also explained the phenomenon of day and night by if the sun \\\"oversteps his measures\\\", then \\\"erinyes, the ministers of justice, will find him out\\\".[105][bt] heraclitus further wrote the sun is in charge of the seasons.[bu] on one account, heraclitus believed the sun and moon were bowls containing fire, with lunar phases explained by the turning of the bowl.[95][102][bv] his study of the moon near the end of the month is contained in one of the oxyrhynchus papyri, a group of manuscripts found in an ancient landfill.[106] this is the best evidence of heraclitean astronomy.[107] heraclitus said \\\"thunderbolt steers all things\\\",[bw] a rare comment on meteorology and likely a reference to zeus as the supreme being.[84] even his theology proves contradictory: \\\"one being, the only wise one, would and would not be called by the name of zeus.\\\"[84][bx] he invokes relativism with the divine too: god sees man the same way man sees children and apes;[80][by][bz] and he seems to give a theodicy, \\\"for god all things are fair and good and just, but men suppose that some are unjust and others just\\\".[84][ca] in parts of animals, aristotle relays this story: \\\"heraclitus, when the strangers who came to visit him found him warming himself at the furnace in the kitchen and hesitated to go in, reported to have bidden them not to be afraid to enter, as even in that kitchen divinities were present, so we should venture on the study of every kind of animal without distaste; for each and all will reveal to us something natural and something beautiful.\\\"[108][cb][note 10] the phrase \\u1f26\\u03b8\\u03bf\\u03c2 \\u1f00\\u03bd\\u03b8\\u03c1\\u03ce\\u03c0\\u1ff3 \\u03b4\\u03b1\\u03af\\u03bc\\u03c9\\u03bd (ethos anthropoi daimon) is attributed to heraclitus. it is variously translated as \\\"a man's character is his fate\\\", \\\"character is destiny\\\", or perhaps most literally as \\\"a man's character is his guardian divinity.\\\"[110][111][112][note 11] the word ethos means \\\"character\\\", while daimon has various meanings, one of which being \\\"the power controlling the destiny of individuals: hence, one's lot or fortune.\\\"[114] heraclitus believed the soul (psyche) was complex, stating: \\\"the limits of the soul you could not discover, though traversing every path.\\\"[115][cc] heraclitus regarded the soul as a mixture of fire and water, and believed that fire was the noble part of the soul and water the ignoble part.[u] he considered mastery of one's worldly desires to be a noble pursuit that purified the soul's fire,[116] while drunkenness damages the soul by causing it to be moist.[cd][v][w] heraclitus seems to advise against anger: \\\"it is hard to fight with anger, for what it wants it buys at the price of the soul.\\\"[117][ce] heraclitus associates being awake with comprehension;[42] as sextus empiricus explains \\\"it is by drawing in this divine reason in respiration that we become endowed with mind and in sleep we become forgetful, but in waking we regain our senses. for in sleep the passages of perception are shut, and hence the mind ... the only thing preserved is the connection through breathing.\\\"[118][cf] heraclitus stated: \\\"if all things should become smoke, then perception would be by the nostrils\\\".[cg] heraclitus compares the soul to a spider and the body to the web.[ch] heraclitus believed the soul is what unifies the body and also what grants linguistic understanding, departing from homer's conception of it as merely the breath of life.[119][120] heraclitus ridicules homer's conception of souls in the afterlife as shades by saying \\\"souls smell in hades\\\".[ci][note 12] his own views on the afterlife remain unclear,[95] but heraclitus did state: \\\"there await men after they are dead things which they do not expect or imagine.\\\"[cj] the aristotelian tradition is responsible for a great part of the transmission of heraclitus's physical conception of the soul.[121] aristotle wrote in de anima: \\\"heraclitus too says that the first principle the 'warm exhalation' of which, according to him, everything else is composed is soul; further, that this exhalation is most incorporeal and in ceaseless flux\\\".[ck] heraclitus's originality and placement near the beginning of greek philosophy has resulted in several writers looking for possible influence from the surrounding nations. the persian empire had a close connection with ephesus and zoroastrianism was the state religion of the persian empire. heraclitus's emphasis on fire has been investigated for influence from zoroastrian fire worship and specifically the concept of atar.[122] while many of the doctrines of zoroastrian fire do not match exactly with those of heraclitus, such as the relation of fire to earth, it is still argued he may have taken some inspiration from them.[122] zoroastrian parallels to heraclitus are often difficult to identify specifically due to a lack of surviving zoroastrian literature from the period and mutual influence with greek philosophy.[note 13] the interchange of other elements with fire also has parallels in vedic literature from the same time period, such as the upanishads.[123] the taittiriya upanishad for instance states \\\"fire is established in water, water is established in fire\\\".[124] heraclitus may have also been influenced by a vedic meditation known as the \\\"doctrine of the five fires.\\\"[125] west however stresses that these doctrines of the interchange of elements were common throughout written works on philosophy that have survived from that period; so heraclitus's doctrine of fire can not be definitively said to have been influenced by any other particular iranian or indian influence, but may have been part of a mutual interchange of influence over time across the ancient near east.[126] philosopher gustav teichm\\u00fcller sought to prove heraclitus was influenced by the egyptians,[127][128] either directly, by reading the book of the dead, or indirectly through the greek mystery cults.[127] \\\"as the sun of heraclitus was daily generated from water, so horus, as ra of the sun, daily proceeded from lotus the water.\\\"[127] paul tannery took up teichm\\u00fcller's interpretation.[129] they both thought heraclitus's book was an offering to the temple to be read only by few initiates, rather than deposited in the temple to the public for safe keeping.[130] edmund pfleiderer argued that heraclitus was influenced by the mystery cults. he interprets heraclitus's apparent condemning of the mystery cults[i][j] as the condemning of abuses rather than the idea itself.[131] heraclitus's writings have exerted a wide influence on western philosophy, including the works of plato and aristotle, who interpreted him in terms of their own doctrines.[132] his influence also extends into art, literature, and even medicine, as writings in the hippocratic corpus show signs of heraclitean themes.[cl][cm] heraclitus is also considered a potential source for understanding the ancient greek religion since the discovery of the derveni papyrus, an orphic poem which contains two fragments of heraclitus.[133][134][135][br][bt] it is unknown whether or not heraclitus had any students in his lifetime.[132] diogenes laertius states heraclitus's book \\\"won so great a fame that there arose followers of him called heracliteans.\\\"[a] scholars took this to mean heraclitus had no disciples and became renowned only after his death.[136] according to one author, \\\"the school of disciples founded by heraclitus flourished for long after his death\\\".[137] according to another, \\\"there were no doubt other heracliteans whose names are now lost to us\\\".[138] in his dialogue cratylus, plato presented cratylus as a heraclitean and as a linguistic naturalist who believed that names must apply naturally to their objects.[139][140] according to aristotle, cratylus went a step beyond his master's doctrine and said that one cannot step into the same river once. he took the view that nothing can be said about the ever changing world and \\\"ended by thinking that one need not say anything, and only moved his finger\\\".[141] to explain both characterizations by plato and aristotle, cratylus may have thought continuous change warrants skepticism because one cannot define a thing that does not have a permanent nature.[142] diogenes laertius also lists an otherwise historically obscure antisthenes who wrote a commentary on heraclitus.[note 14] the pythagorean and comic writer epicharmus of kos has fragments which seem to reproduce the thought of heraclitus, and wrote a play titled heraclitus.[143][144] parmenides of elea, a philosopher and near contemporary, proposed a doctrine of changelessness, in contrast to the doctrine of flux put forth by heraclitus.[145][146] he is generally agreed to either have influenced or been influenced by heraclitus.[132][146] different philosophers have argued that either one of them may have substantially influenced each other, some taking heraclitus to be responding to parmenides, but more often parmenides is seen as responding to heraclitus.[146][147] some also argue that any direct chain of influence between the two is impossible to determine.[146] although heraclitus refers to older figures such as pythagoras,[a][q] neither parmenides or heraclitus refer to each other by name in any surviving fragments, so any speculation on influence must be based on interpretation.[146] the surviving fragments of several other pre socratic philosophers show heraclitean themes.[132] diogenes of apollonia thought the action of one thing on another meant they were made of one substance.[80] the pluralists may have been influenced by heraclitus. the philosopher anaxagoras refuses to separate the opposites in the \\\"one cosmos\\\".[80] empedocles has forces (arguably the first since heraclitus's tension)[65] which are in opposition, known as love and hate, or more accurately, harmony and strife.[80] democritus and the atomists were also influenced by heraclitus.[132] the atomists and heraclitus both believed that everything was in motion.[148][149][as] on one interpretation: \\\"essentially what the atomists did was try to find a middle way between the contradictory philosophical schemes of heraclitus and parmenides.\\\"[150] the sophists, including protagoras of abdera and gorgias of leontini, may also have been influenced by heraclitus. sophists in general seemed to share heraclitus's conception of the logos.[70] one tradition associated the sophists' concern with politics and preventing party strife with heraclitus.[151][152] heraclitus and others used \\\"measure\\\" to mean the balance and order of nature; hence protagoras' famous statement \\\"man is the measure of all things\\\".[153] in plato's dialogue theaetetus, socrates sees protagoras's \\\"man is the measure\\\" doctrine and theaetetus' hypothesis that \\\"knowledge is perception\\\" as justified by heraclitean flux.[154] gorgias seems to have been influenced by the logos, when he argued in his work on non being, possibly parodying the eleatics, that being cannot exist or be communicated. according to one author, gorgias \\\"in a sense ... completes heraclitus.\\\"[151] plato knew of the teachings of heraclitus through the heraclitean philosopher cratylus.[141] plato held that for heraclitus knowledge is made impossible by the flux of sensible objects, and thus the need for the imperceptible forms as objects of knowledge.[48][155] scythinus of teos, a contemporary of plato, wrote out heraclitus's philosophy in verse.[156][157][cn] a four volume work on heraclitus was written by the academic heraclides ponticus, but has not survived.[158] plutarch also wrote a lost treatise on heraclitus.[159] the neoplatonists were influenced by heraclitus on the topic of the one; quoting plotinus \\\"heraclitus, with his sense of bodily forms as things of ceaseless process and passage, knows the one as eternal and intellectual.\\\"[160][161] aristotle accused heraclitus of denying the law of noncontradiction, and charges that he thereby failed in his reasoning.[ae] however, aristotle's material monist and world conflagration (ekpyrosis) interpretation of heraclitus influenced the stoics.[87][80][162] the stoics believed major tenets of their philosophy derived from the thought of heraclitus; especially the logos, used to support their belief that rational law governs the universe.[163][164] scholar a. a. long concludes the earliest stoic fragments are \\\"modifications of heraclitus\\\".[165] according to philosopher philip hallie, \\\"heraclitus of ephesus was the father of stoic physics.\\\"[166] a four volume work titled interpretation of heraclitus was written by the stoic philosopher cleanthes, but has not survived.[132][167][a] in surviving stoic writings, heraclitean influence is most evident in the writings of marcus aurelius.[168] marcus aurelius understood the logos as \\\"the account which governs everything\\\".[169][co] heraclitus also states, \\\"we should not act and speak like children of our parents\\\", which marcus aurelius interpreted to mean one should not simply accept what others believe.[170][cp] many of the later stoics interpreted the logos as the arche, as a creative fire that ran through all things;[171] west observes that plato, aristotle, theophrastus, and sextus empiricus all make no mention of this doctrine, and concludes that the language and thought are \\\"obviously stoic\\\" and not attributable to heraclitus.[172] burnet cautions that these stoic modifications of heraclitus make it harder to interpret heraclitus himself, as the stoics ascribed their own interpretations of terms like logos and ekpyrosis to heraclitus.[173] the cynics were influenced by heraclitus, such as by his condemnation of the mystery cults.[26][174][j] heraclitus is sometimes even depicted as a cynic. the cynics attributed several of the later cynic epistles to his authorship.[7] according to one source, \\\"the cynic affinity with heraclitus lies not so much in his philosophy as in his cultural criticism and (idealised) lifestyle.\\\"[175] heraclitus wrote: \\\"dogs bark at every one they do not know.\\\"[cq] similarly, diogenes the cynic, when asked by alexander why he considered himself a dog, responded that he \\\"barks at those who give me nothing\\\".[176][177] the skeptical philosophers known as pyrrhonists were also influenced by heraclitus. he may be the predecessor to pyrrho's relativistic doctrine \\\"no more this than that \\\", that nothing is one way rather than another way.[138] according to pyrrhonist sextus empiricus, aenesidemus, one of the major ancient pyrrhonist philosophers, claimed in a now lost work that pyrrhonism was a way to heraclitean philosophy because pyrrhonist practice helps one to see how opposites appear to be the case about the same thing, leading to the heraclitean view that opposites actually are true about the same thing.[178][179] sextus empiricus disagreed, arguing opposites appearing to be the case about the same thing is not a dogma of the pyrrhonists but a matter occurring to the pyrrhonists, to the other philosophers, and to all of humanity.[179] heraclitus was often read by early christian philosophers, who[180] following the stoics, interpreted the logos as meaning the christian \\\"word of god\\\", such as in john 1:1: \\\"in the beginning was the word (logos) and the word was god.\\\" hippolytus of rome, one of the early church fathers of the christian church, identified heraclitus along with the other pre socratics and academics as a source of heresy, in heraclitus's case namely the heresy of noetus.[180] the christian apologist justin martyr took a more positive view of heraclitus.[181] in his first apology, he said both socrates and heraclitus were christians before christ: \\\"those who lived reasonably are christians, even though they have been thought atheists; as, among the greeks, socrates and heraclitus, and men like them.\\\"[182] the christian clement of alexandria notes heraclitus's similarity to the christian prophets, and is cited as a source for more heraclitus fragments than any other author.[183][184] modern scholars such as john burnet have viewed the relationship between heraclitean logos and johannine logos as fallacious, saying; \\\"the johannine doctrine of the logos has nothing to do with herakleitos or with anything at all in greek philosophy, but comes from the hebrew wisdom literature\\\".[19] when heraclitus speaks of \\\"god\\\" he does not mean a single deity as an omnipotent and omniscient or god as creator, the universe being eternal; he meant the divine as opposed to human, the immortal as opposed to the mortal, and the cyclical as opposed to the transient. thus, it is arguably more accurate to speak of \\\"the divine\\\" and not of \\\"god\\\".[185] heraclitus's influence also extends outside of philosophy. a motif found in art and literature is heraclitus as the \\\"weeping philosopher\\\" and democritus as the \\\"laughing philosopher\\\", which may have originated with the cynic philosopher menippus,[186] and generally references their reactions to the folly of mankind.[187][188][189] for example, in lucian of samosata's \\\"philosophies for sale\\\", heraclitus is auctioned off as the \\\"weeping philosopher\\\" and democritus as the \\\"laughing philosopher\\\".[cr] the roman poet juvenal wrote: \\\"heraclitus, weep at life much more than you did while alive, for now life is more pitiable.\\\"[190] the renaissance saw a revived interest in ancient philosophy and its depiction in art. a fresco on the wall of marsilio ficino's platonic academy in florence depicted heraclitus and democritus.[191] donato bramante painted heraclitus and democritus (1486) as the weeping and laughing philosopher, and may have depicted heraclitus as leonardo da vinci.[192] heraclitus appears in painter raphael's school of athens (1511), in which he is represented by michelangelo, since they shared a \\\"sour temper and bitter scorn for all rivals\\\".[193] modern interest in early greek philosophy can be traced back to 1573, when french printer henri estienne (also known as henricus stephanus) collected a number of pre socratic fragments, including some forty of those of heraclitus, and published them in latin in poesis philosophica.[194] renaissance skeptic michel de montaigne's essay on democritus and heraclitus, in which he sided with the laughing philosopher over the weeping philosopher, was probably written soon after.[195][196][197] heraclitus also influenced french poets michel d'ambroise and etienne forcadel.[198] huguenot minister pierre du moulin wrote heraclitus, or, meditations vpon the vanity & misery of humane life in 1609.[199][200] english playwright william shakespeare may have known of heraclitus through montaigne.[201] the merchant of venice (1598) features the melancholic character of antonio, who some critics contend is modeled after heraclitus.[189] additionally, in one scene of the play portia assesses her potential suitors, and says of one county palatine: \\\"i fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old\\\".[202][203] several baroque artists such as peter paul rubens, hendrik ter brugghen, and johannes moreelse painted heraclitus and democritus. rubens' heraclitus and democritus (1603) was painted for the duke of lerma.[204] french rationalist philosopher ren\\u00e9 descartes read montaigne and wrote in the passions of the soul that indignation can be joined by pity or derision, \\\"so the laughter of democritus and the tears of heraclitus could have come from the same cause\\\".[205][206] kahn suggests spinoza may have been influenced by heraclitus via the stoics.[207] according to one author \\\"what heraclitus really meant by the common was...nothing different from what by spinoza was expressed by \\\"sub specie aeternitatis\\\".[208] according to german poet heinrich bl\\u00fccher, \\\"if you read the whole system of spinoza, it is nothing but the changed system of heraclitus.\\\"[209] gottfried wilhelm leibniz stated in the monadology \\\"all bodies are in a state of perpetual flux like rivers.\\\"[210][211] bishop and empiricist philosopher george berkeley claimed sir isaac newton's alchemy was influenced by heraclitus. he remarked in siris: \\\"in plutarch we find it was the opinion of heraclitus, that the death of fire was a birth to air, and the death of air a birth to water.[bm] this opinion is also maintained by sir isaac newton.\\\"[212] scottish skeptic david hume seems to recapitulate heraclitus while discussing personal identity: \\\"thus as the nature of a river consists in the motion and change of parts; tho' in less than four and twenty hours these be totally alter'd; this hinders not the river from continuing the same during several ages.\\\"[213][214][215] while heraclitus seems to criticize people in general, at other times he also seems to support common sense.[216] on scottish common sense philosopher thomas reid's account, heraclitus was one of the first to extol a common sense philosophy with such quotes as \\\"and though reason is common, most people live as though they had an understanding peculiar to themselves;\\\"[h] and \\\"understanding is common to all\\\".[217][cs] ever since german philosopher immanuel kant, philosophers have sometimes been divided into rationalists and empiricists.[218] heraclitus has been considered each by different scholars.[43][219] for rationalism,[220][221] philosophers cite fragments like \\\"poor witnesses for men are the eyes and ears of those who have barbarian souls.\\\"[cf][ct] for empiricism,[222] they cite fragments like \\\"the things that can be seen, heard, and learned are what i prize the most.\\\"[cu] gottlob mayer has argued that the philosophical pessimism of arthur schopenhauer recapitulated the thought of heraclitus.[223][224] the impression of heraclitus on german idealist g. w. f. hegel was so profound that he remarked in his lectures on the history of philosophy: \\\"there is no proposition of heraclitus which i have not adopted in my logic.\\\"[225] hegel interpreted heraclitus as a dialetheist and as a process philosopher, seeing the flux or \\\"becoming\\\" in heraclitus as a natural result of the ontology of \\\"being\\\" and \\\"non being\\\" in parmenides.[132] he also doubted the world conflagration (ekpyrosis) interpretation, which had been popular since aristotle.[84] the german theologian friedrich schleiermacher was one of the first to collect the fragments of heraclitus specifically and write them out in his native tongue, the \\\"pioneer of heraclitean studies\\\".[226][227][228] schleiermacher was also one of the first to posit persian influence upon heraclitus, a question taken up by succeeding scholars friedrich creuzer and august gladisch.[180][227] the young hegelian and socialist ferdinand lassalle wrote a book on heraclitus.[229] \\\"lassalle follows hegel in styling the doctrine of heraclitus 'the philosophy of the logical law of the identity of contradictories.\\\"[180][230] lassalle also thought persian theology influenced heraclitus.[128][220][231] fellow young hegelian karl marx compared lasalle's work to that of \\\"a schoolboy\\\"[232] and vladimir lenin accused him of \\\"sheer plagiarism\\\".[231] classical philologist jakob bernays also wrote a work on heraclitus.[180] inspired by bernays, the english scholar ingram bywater collected all fragments of heraclitus in a critical edition, heracliti ephesii reliquiae (1877).[233] an english translation was provided by g. t. w. patrick in 1889.[20] hermann diels wrote \\\"bywater's book has come to be accounted ... as the only reliable collection of the remains of that philosopher.\\\"[233] diels published the first edition of the authoritative die fragmente der vorsokratiker (the fragments of the pre socratics) in 1903, later revised and expanded three times, and finally revised in two subsequent editions by walther kranz. diels kranz is used in academia to cite pre socratic philosophers. in diels kranz, each ancient personality and each passage is assigned a number to uniquely identify it; heraclitus is traditionally catalogued as philosopher number 22.[234] the continental existentialist and classical philologist friedrich nietzsche preferred heraclitus above all the other pre socratics.[31][235][236] nietzsche saw the philosophers before plato as \\\"pure types\\\" and heraclitus as the proud, lonely truth finder.[237][238] the nationalist philosopher of history oswald spengler wrote his (failed) dissertation on heraclitus.[239][240] phenomenologist edmund husserl wrote that consciousness is \\\"the realm of heraclitean flux.\\\"[241] existentialist and phenomenologist martin heidegger was also influenced by heraclitus, as seen in his introduction to metaphysics. heidegger believed that the thinking of heraclitus and parmenides was the origin of philosophy and misunderstood by plato and aristotle, leading all of western philosophy astray.[242][243] french philosophers jacques derrida and gilles deleuze's \\\"differential ontology\\\" is influenced by heraclitus.[244][245] according to deleuze, michel foucault was a heraclitean.[246][247] the idea that war produces order through strife is similar to foucault's notion that power is a force dispersed through social relations.[248] in the 1950s, a term originating with heraclitus, \\\"idios kosmos\\\", meaning \\\"private world\\\" as distinguished from the \\\"common world\\\" (koinos kosmos) was adopted by phenomenological and existential psychologists, such as ludwig binswanger and rollo may, to refer to the experience of people with delusions.[249] it was an important part of novelist philip k. dick's views on schizophrenia.[250] those thinkers have relied on heraclitus's statement that \\\"the waking have one common world, but the sleeping turn aside each into a world of his own.\\\"[cv] the irish author and classicist oscar wilde was influenced by art critic walter pater, a friend of bywater's whose \\\"pre socratic hero\\\" was heraclitus.[251][252][253] harold bloom noted that \\\"pater praises plato for classic correctness, for a conservative centripetal impulse, against his [pater's] own heraclitean romanticism.\\\"[254] wilde is credited with the saying \\\"expect the unexpected\\\", though heraclitus said \\\"if you do not expect the unexpected, you will not find it; for it is hard to be sought out and difficult.\\\"[255][cw] the british process philosopher a. n. whitehead has been identified as a representative of the tradition of heraclitus.[256][257][258] in bertrand russell's essay mysticism and logic, he contends heraclitus proves himself a metaphysician by his blending of mystical and scientific impulses.[101] scholar edward hussey sees parallels between heraclitus, the logos, and the early ludwig wittgenstein's linguistic philosophy in the tractatus (1922).[259] wittgenstein was known to read plato[260] and in his return to philosophy in 1929 he made several remarks resembling those of heraclitus: \\\"the fundamental thing expressed grammatically: what about the sentence: one cannot step into the same river twice?\\\"[261] he then seemed to make a dramatic shift by 1931, saying one can step twice into the same river.[262] wittgenstein also uses a river image in on certainty (1950) to say even the river bed may change as foundational logical principles might: \\\"the mythology may change back into a state of flux, the river bed of thoughts may shift ... and the bank of that river consists partly of hard rock, subject to no alteration or only to an imperceptible one, partly of sand, which now in one place now in another gets washed away or deposited.\\\"[263][264] aristotle's arguments for the law of non contradiction, which he saw as refuting the position started by heraclitus,[265] used to be considered authoritative, but have been in doubt ever since their criticism by polish logician jan \\u0142ukasiewicz, and the invention of many valued and paraconsistent logics.[266][267] some philosophers such as graham priest and jc beall follow heraclitus in advocating true contradictions or dialetheism,[47] seeing it as the most natural response to the liar paradox.[268][269][270][note 15] jc beall, together with greg restall, is a pioneer of a widely discussed version of logical pluralism.[272] beall argues for a contradictory account of jesus christ as both man and divine.[273] the philosopher peter geach was inspired by heraclitus's comments on the river to formulate his idea of relative identity,[274][275] which he used

he calls the \\\"a theory\\\", also known as \\\"temporal becoming\\\", and closely related to presentism, which conceptualizes of time as tensed (i.e., having the properties of being past, present, or future), is a view which has been seen as beginning with heraclitus.[278][279][280] by contrast, his \\\" \\\"b theory\\\", under which time is tenseless (i.e., earlier than, simultaneous to, or

homo sapiens. we evolved only relatively recently but with complex culture and technology have been able to spread throughout the world and occupy a range of different environments. 300,000 years ago to present: the name we selected for ourselves means \\u2018wise human\\u2019. homo is the latin word for \\u2018human\\u2019 or \\u2018man\\u2019 and sapiens is derived from a latin word that means \\u2018wise\\u2019 or \\u2018astute\\u2019. various names have been used for our species including: uncover the secrets of the australian museum with our monthly emails. fossils of the earliest members of our species, archaic homo sapiens, have all been found in africa. fossils of modern homo sapiens have been found in africa and in many other sites across much of the world. sites older than 150k include florisbad, omo kibish, ngaloba and herto. sites dating to about 100k include klasies river mouth, border cave, skhul and qafzeh. sites younger than 40k include dolni vestonice, cro magnon, aurignac and lake mungo. homo sapiens evolved in africa from homo heidelbergensis. they co existed for a long time in europe and the middle east with the neanderthals, and possibly with homo erectus in asia and homo floresiensis in indonesia, but are now the only surviving human species. for information on modern humans interbreeding with other human species see: when and where did our species originate? african fossils provide the best evidence for the evolutionary transition from homo heidelbergensis to archaic homo sapiens and then to early modern homo sapiens. there is, however, some difficulty in placing many of the transitional specimens into a particular species because they have a mixture of intermediate features which are especially apparent in the sizes and shapes of the forehead, brow ridge and face. some suggest the name homo helmei for these intermediate specimens that represent populations on the brink of becoming modern. late surviving populations of archaic homo sapiens and homo heidelbergensis lived alongside early modern homo sapiens before disappearing from the fossil record by about 100,000 years ago. key specimens that reveal an evolutionary transition from archaic to modern homo sapiens include florisbad cranium, lh18 from laetoli, omo 1 and 2 from omo kibish, herto skull from ethiopia and skhul 5 from israel. homo sapiens skulls have a distinctive shape that differentiates them from earlier human species. their body shape tends to vary, however, due to adaptation to a wide range of environments. the earliest homo sapiens had a relatively simple culture, although it was more advanced than any previous species. rare evidence for symbolic behaviour appears at a number of african sites about 100,000 years ago, but these artistic expressions appear more of a flicker of creativity than a sustained expression. it is not until about 40,000 years ago that complex and highly innovative cultures appear and include behaviour that we would recognise as typical of modern humans today. many researchers believe this explosion of artistic material in the archaeological record about 40,000 years ago is due to a change in human cognition   perhaps humans developed a greater ability to think and communicate symbolically or memorise better. however, as there are obvious attempts at art before this, perhaps there are other reasons. one theory is that population size and structure play a key role as social learning is considered more beneficial to developing complex culture than individual innovations are. bigger populations often accumulate more cultural attributes than isolated groups. initially, homo sapiens made stone tools such as flakes, scrapers and points that were similar in design to those made by the neanderthals (homo neanderthalensis). this technology appeared about 250,000 years ago, coinciding with the probable first appearance of early homo sapiens. it required an ability for abstract thought to mentally plan a series of steps that could then be executed. only a small number of tools were produced from each core (the original stone selected for shaping) but the tools produced by this prepared core method maximised the cutting edge available. historically, archaeologists used different terminologies for lower palaeolithic cultures in different parts of the world. many of these terms are now consolidated within the mode 3 technology to emphasise the similarities between these technologies. as more sophisticated techniques developed in some parts of the world, this early mode 3 technology was replaced by either mode 4 or mode 5 technology and the use of a wider range of materials including bone, ivory and antler. mode 4 technology first appeared in africa about 100,000 years ago. it is characterised by the production of long, thin stone flakes that were shaped into long blade knives, spearheads and other tools. mode 5 technology specialised in the production of very small blades (microliths) that were often used in composite tools having several parts. these tools included small headed arrows, barbed spears and sickles. regional variation in these tool cultures developed with an influx of new styles and techniques especially within the last 40,000 years, including the magdalenian and aurignacian. sophisticated control of fire, including complex hearths, pits and kilns, allowed homo sapiens to survive in regions that even the cold adapted neanderthals had been unable to inhabit. the cro magnon site at dolni vestonice in the czech republic produced the earliest evidence for high temperature kilns and ceramic technology. the kilns, dated at 26,000 years old, were capable of firing clay figurines at temperatures over 400 degrees celsius. about 2000 fired lumps of clay were found scattered around the kiln. animal hide clothing may have been worn in cooler areas, although direct evidence of clothing only exists for the last 30,000 years. this evidence includes specialised tools such as needles; adornments such as buttons and beads sewn onto clothing; and the remains of animals, such as arctic foxes and wolves, that indicate they were trapped for their fur. clothes that were sewn provided better protection from the cold than clothes that were merely tied together. fibres from flax plants were discovered in a cave in georgia in 2009, dating to about 36,000 years old. the flax was most likely used to make clothes and woven baskets, and a small number appear to be dyed. they are the oldest example of their kind ever found. textile impressions have been discovered at other european sites have, but no actual remains. items of personal adornment not sewn onto clothing include ivory, shell, amber, bone and tooth beads and pendants. ostrich eggshell beads that date from about 45,000 years ago have been found in africa, as well as pierced shell beads in morocco dating to 80,000 years ago and marine shell beads from israel dating to 90,000 years old, but body adornment only become prolific from about 35,000 years ago. one of the earliest known pendants is a horse carved in mammoth ivory from vogelherd, germany. it is dated at 32,000 years old. body adornments like this are evidence that humans had progressed from merely trying to survive and were now concerned with their appearance. cave art began to be produced about 40,000 years ago in europe and australia. most of the art depicts animals or probable spiritual beings, but smaller marks in many caves in france, and possibly others in europe, are now being analysed as they may be a written 'code' familiar to many prehistoric tribes. in particular, 26 symbols appear over and over again across thousand of years, some of them in pairs and groups in what could be a rudimentary 'language'. these suggest that early europeans were attempting to represent ideas symbolically rather than realistically and share information acorss generations. the oldest of these symbols date to about 30,000 years old. evidence of musical instruments first appeared about 32,000 years ago in europe. palaeolithic bone flutes and whistles from various sites in france range in age from 30,000 to 10,000 years old. portable artwork, such as carved statuettes, first appeared about 35 40,000 years ago in europe. venus figurines were widespread in europe by 28,000 years ago. fragments from germany found in 2009, suggest their origins started at least 35,000 years ago. an ivory female head with bun from dolni vestonice, czech republic, is one of only 2 human head carvings from this period that show eye sockets, eyelids and eyeballs. it is dated at 26,000 years old. red ochre pieces from blombos cave in south africa, dating to about 100 80,000 years ago, show evidence of engraving that may be an expression of art or simply incidental marking made during other activities. however, other signs of possible symbolic behaviour, including shell beads and sophisticated tools (known as still bay points) have also come from this site, strengthening the case for early artistic expression. early homo sapiens often inhabited caves or rock shelters if these were available. more recently, especially within the last 20,000 years, natural shelters were enhanced with walls or other simple modifications. in open areas, shelters were constructed using a range of framework materials including wooden poles and the bones of large animals, such as mammoths. these structures were probably covered with animal hides and the living areas included fire hearths. living sites were much larger than those occupied by earlier humans and a comparison with modern traditional peoples suggests that clans consisted of between 25 and 100 members. burials were infrequent and very simple prior to 40,000 years ago and then began to become more elaborate with the inclusion of valued objects such as tools and body adornments. red ochre was sprinkled over many of the bodies prior to burial. one of the earliest deliberate burials of a modern human comes from jebel qafzeh in israel. dating to 90,000 years old, the grave contains the bones of a young woman buried with a young child at her feet. an additional 21 skeletons were found in the same cave. early modern humans were adapted to life in the tropics but by 40,000 years ago they occupied a range of environments across the continents of africa, europe, asia and australia. within the last 20,000 years humans have also spread into the americas. today, our culture and technology allows us to live in most environments on our planet as well as some off our planet. all homo sapiens were once hunter gatherers living on wild plants and animals. it was only about 11,000 years ago that humans began to domesticate plants and animals although wild foods still remained important in the diet. our species has a wide ranging and essentially omnivorous diet. this has enabled us to utilise the food resources found in the wide variety of environments we inhabit. reconstructing the physical environment in which our ancestors lived allows us to gain a greater understanding of their day to day lives. environments on both local and broader scales are greatly affected by climate, so climate change is an important area of study in reconstructing past environments physical and genetic changes have occurred within our species and will continue to occur at a basic level as new genes evolve. however, these changes may not be as dramatic as they were in the past as the situation today does not favour the evolution of a new human species. the bones of some ancient individuals can tell us how their owners died. some individuals had diseases that can be seen from the structure of their bones or teeth. some had physical injuries that produce unique types of damage. a key specimen of the human story, its position on our family tree is highly debated. is it the oldest known hominin or should it be placed on the tree before the human line split from the line leading to chimpanzees? one of the most controversial and surprising hominin finds in a century. the genus or group paranthropus currently includes three species, p. boisei, p. robustus, and p. aethiopicus. they are collectively known as the \\u2018robusts\\u2019 because of their extremely large jaws and molar teeth. they are our distant \\u2018cousins\\u2019 rather than our direct relatives. 1912   piltdown man \\u2018discovered\\u2019 in england. this species is one of the best known of our ancestors. fossils are fascinating reminders of life in ancient times. they can also reveal an amazing amount of information. fossils have, for example, helped us work out who some of our direct ancestors might be. this species name is highly debated with many considering the remains to be homo heidelbergensis. whatever species they come from, these fossils are the oldest homo found in europe. this hominin lived 2.5 million years and, although similar to other australopithecines, it displayed some surprising features. the only species in this genus, this hominin lived about 3 million years ago. however, the species name is based on a distorted and fragmented skull and many debate its validity. the australian museum respects and acknowledges the gadigal people as the first peoples and traditional

enclosure usually includes a few hundred invited guests as well as the royal family.\\n\\nit is a centrepiece of britain's social calendar, a place where pageantry, fashion and thoroughbred animals have come to be part of the mix since queen anne first saw its potential as a racecourse 300 years ago. yet after organisers at royal ascot decided that sartorial standards have been on the slide in recent times, not even her descendents are being spared a clampdown that could end the wearing of fascinators in the royal enclosure. the item of headgear, often favoured by the duchess of cambridge, is under threat as part of a move to tighten and clarify the dress code at the annual summer event, which also happens to be the queen's favourite race meet. nick smith, a spokesman for ascot, said: \\\"it is stretching a point to say standards have collapsed but there is no doubt that our customers would like to get back to a situation where it is universally acknowledged that this is a formal occasion and not an occasion where you might dress as you would at a nightclub. \\\"it is probably fair to say that the dress code hasn't necessarily been enforced quite as rigorously as we might have liked.\\\" along with the royals, thousands of visitors who flock to the less formal grandstand enclosure during the week long meet in june will also be obliged to adhere to strict new guidelines. the less formal silver ring is not expected to be affected by the changes. a new dress code states: \\\"hats should be worn; a headpiece which has a base of four inches (10cm) or more in diameter is acceptable as an alternative to a hat.\\\" women will also be expected to wear skirts or dresses of \\\"modest length\\\" that fall just above the knee or longer. this clarifies previous guidance which stated that miniskirts were \\\"considered unsuitable\\\". for men, a waistcoat and tie are now compulsory in this area of the course and cravats will not be allowed. black shoes must also be worn with morning dress. although rules on the wearing of fascinators in the royal enclosure will be tightened, a hat or fascinator will be compulsory for women in the grandstand, which is open to the public and subject to less stringent rules. the move comes amid criticism of sartorial standards, often led by some press coverage bemoaning the supposed display of too much flesh at race meets, and marks a significant change to previous years, when female race goers were advised that \\\"many ladies wear hats\\\". strapless or sheer strap tops and dresses will be banned. for men, a suit and tie will now be imperative. charles barnett, ascot's chief executive, said the overarching intention was to be \\\"as helpful as possible\\\" to visitors and to assist racegoers in understanding what is \\\"cherished\\\" about the dress code at royal ascot. \\\"it isn't a question of elitism and not being modern in a world where there is less and less requirement to dress smartly   far from it,\\\" he said. \\\"we want to see modern and stylish dress at royal ascot, just within the parameters of formal wear, and the feedback we have received from our customers overwhelmingly supports that.\\\"\\n\\nlondon   they're good enough for the former kate middleton, but apparently not good enough for her husband's grandmother, queen elizabeth ii. fascinators   the delicate, whimsical pieces of headwear favored by the young and posh in britain and beyond   have been banned from the royal enclosure at royal ascot, one of the most exclusive events in britain's social calendar. organizers said wednesday that those hoping to rub shoulders with the queen at the horse racing meet would have to stick to hats, no fascinators. it's the latest in a series of rules aimed at tightening the dress code at ascot, where organizers have tried to push back against the proliferation of provocative outfits, outrageous accessories and revealing tops. other rules introduced or reinforced wednesday include the requirement that women at the royal enclosure wear dresses that fall below the knee and that the men accompanying them must wear a top hat (gray or black). the queen can wear whatever she wants, but the guidelines affect the royal enclosure, which usually includes a few hundred invited guests, not just the royal family. some of the rules   no bare midriffs or strapless dresses for example   fall in line with organizers' attempts to roll back the nouveau riche nightclub look, but fascinators are favored by the highest reaches of the upper crust. the headgear can consist of flowers, fabric, feathers, lace, netting, or just about anything else that catches the eye and matches the dress. unlike hats, which generally just sit on the wearer's head, fascinators tend to be smaller and are often fastened using barrettes or headbands. kate middleton, now known as the duchess of cambridge, is a fan   her repeat outings with feathery, frothy accouterments last year reportedly sparked a british sales surge. so too are princesses beatrice and eugenie and other fashion forward royals. nick smith, ascot's head of communication, acknowledged that \\\"there is an argument that some fascinators are formal.\\\" \\\"but the very fact that there is that argument\\\" was reason enough to ban them from the royal enclosure   where the queen gathers with the cream of british aristocracy to watch the races. \\\"some fascinators have become so small that they're nothing more than a hairband and a feather,\\\" he added. so did elizabeth call up to say: \\\"off with their fascinators!\\\" smith laughed. \\\"no, that doesn't happen,\\\" he said. \\\"we set the rules.\\\" still, he noted that organizers were in touch with the queen's staff and he said it would be \\\"unlikely that we'd put something in place that she'd be uncomfortable with.\\\" the next ascot takes place in june. online: ascot: http://www.ascot.co.uk/\\n\\nsunday 17

tighten and clarify the dress code at the annual summer event comes amid criticism of sartorial standards which have been more loosely enforced in recent years. a selection of waistcoats, ties, pashminas and other items will be available at the turnstiles for those who are not up to scratch. the new dress code was first announced in january and organisers sent out reminders with badges and tickets. charles barnett, chief executive of ascot, said: \\\"ascot is europe's flagship race meeting and one of the world's greatest sporting and social events. we have tried to provide an appropriate dress code that is clear, workable and in line with the wishes of racegoers. \\\"over the last few months, a huge amount of planning has gone in to making sure that the implementation of

not necessarily. but why wouldn\\u2019t you choose to make the most of the opportunity to wear a hat? wearing a hat to the races is all part of the fun! choosing your race day outfit can be overwhelming, leaving you saddled with the responsibility of making the right choice. dress codes at uk racecourses can be strict, sometimes seemingly old fashioned and often very traditional. while you don\\u2019t need to wear a hat for the races for most courses and occasions, if you\\u2019re sitting in a royal enclosure, it is required that ladies must wear a hat or headpiece at all times. dress codes for royal enclosures accept a headpiece with a solid base of at least 4 inches is permitted. fascinators are not acceptable. when it comes down to it, check your tickets   if you are in a royal enclosure you must wear a hat. if you are elsewhere, hats and fascinators might be optional. check the dress code at your racecourse before the big race day to allow yourself plenty of time to find the perfect headpiece if you need one. wearing a hat has become synonymous with going to the races, whether it\\u2019s a top hat for chaps or a wide brim for ladies day. it\\u2019s a deeply entrenched tradition and has always been associated with showing off your fashion credentials. from a more practical point of view though, nottingham in november or cheltenham in spring can be parky, and a felt hat may be a very welcome accessory. millinery trends around the world are influenced by looks from the racecourses. it\\u2019s always worth looking to australia in winter to see what is going to be in the running, at the final furlong, come summer. however, these days, the excuse to get dressed up to the nines part of the fun and the whole race day experience. one ladies day tradition, the \\u201cbest dressed\\u201d pageant, is certainly one place where the competition can be fierce and the prizes lucrative! so the truthful answer to the question \\u201cdo you have to wear a hat to the races?\\u201d is\\u2026 it depends! however, i would love to help you to find the perfect hat for race day. my collection of occasion hats features my signature style millinery; offering unique and elegant designs that you\\u2019ll be able to pair with your beautiful outfit. i also offer a bespoke millinery service if you are looking to create a unique headpiece, you can book a consultation here. 1) check the dress code for your enclosure and make sure your headwear fits the rules.size matters   in some areas of royal ascot, wearing a huge hat is discouraged due to the crowds. whereas in other areas of the course, go too small and you risk getting in trouble with the \\u201cfashion police\\u201d. 2) choose your outfit as soon as possiblesummer is an incredibly busy time for milliners. the racing calendar starts in cheltenham (march) so through until september and the st leger festival, things are busy. weddings, palace events (tea parties and investitures), henley and a whole host of other seasonal formal events are in full swing. and that\\u2019s just considering uk events, i sell internationally as well. i ask for 6 8 weeks for bespoke orders, and my appointment diary fills up very quickly. 3) think about the season and weatherstraws (including paper) and sinamay are great for spring/summer; felts and velvet are better suited for cooler weather. brimmed hats can be great for offering a little shade on a sunny day, but a strong gust of wind might result in you chasing your hat across the course. you can see my suggestions for race day hats across the seasons here: spring, summer, autumn, winter 4) choose a hat you feel comfortable wearingwhen you are comfortable, you are confident, and nothing can spoil your day\\u2026you will look and feel great! it\\u2019s classic headology. everyone thinks of race day hats as being large affairs, however a smaller hat can make a statement just as effectively. zara tindall always looks hot to trot wearing her signature smaller scale cocktail hats. 5) consider your colours carefullyit can be tempting to try and match your accessories exactly to your outfit. my advice is to treat this approach with caution. by choosing complimentary tones instead, you\\u2019ll have more of an opportunity to pair your headwear with alternative outfits in the future. (and should your headwear need a bit of a tweak for the next hat worthy event, i offer a retrimming service) and an extra bonus tip; check the weather forecast if it looks like rain, make sure you have a brolly! most occasion hats do not like getting wet, so take a tip from a world renowned and professional hat wearer. the queen has an iconic line in transparent domed umbrellas   perfect for

my partner\\u2019s gucci suit). and my husband and i got ready for the lunchtime ceremony together, having chosen to walk down the aisle side by side. for me, those decisions were a no brainer, but they left a ce,rtain member of my bridal party just a soup\\u00e7on stressed. my mom was perplexed over whether, to attend her daughter\\u2019s fairly low key london wedding in the spring, she should wear a hat, a fascinator, or an (entirely new to me but apparently very big in the mother of the bride community) alternative known as a \\u201chatinator.\\u201d not helping mom\\u2019s millinery musings? she had heard word of weddings where fascinators had, either due to their apparent informality or bridal misgivings, been banned. princess beatrice, sarah ferguson, duchess of york, and princess eugenie attend the wedding of louis buckworth and chloe delevingne in 2007 in london. princess eugenie, zara tindall, and the princess of wales attend royal ascot in 2019 drawing on her

alternative to a hat.\\u201d it\\u2019s ironic that ascot\\u2019s royal enclosure discourages fascinators, as they\\u2019re the millinery must have at many other events on the society calendar. in hat history, the fascinator dates back to the 1770s and marie antoinette, who placed feathers and gems amidst her rococo ringlets. come the king\\u2019s coronation on 6 may, royal watchers will have their eyes peeled not just for operation golden orb\\u2019s associated priceless regalia (coronets, swords, scepters et al), but also the fascinators festooning the modern elite\\u2019s pompadours. so who is responsible for the royals appearing to be, at times, a little gung ho with the glue gun? princess diana wears a polka dot print blouse by donald campbell and a matching disc shaped hat by john boyd in perth, australia, 1983. instead of wearing a traditional tiara to her 2005 wedding to king charles, camilla chose two philip treacy creations, including this wheat sheaf adorned headband. the princess of wales chose a netted fascinator for the wedding of princess eugenie of york and jack brooksbank in 2018. we can thank princess diana for many things when it comes to style retro lo fi gym and ski looks, lessons in revenge dressing, color pop skirt suits, and prairie collars among them. and also, in the \\u201980s, the not quite a hat. she had a selection of wide brimmed and pillbox hats by philip somerville, catherine walker, viv knowland, and john boyd, but also many headpieces that were disc shaped and compact, worn to weddings and ceremonial events, that might veer into, in modern parlance, \\u201chatinator\\u201d territory. queen camilla will be trading up from her beloved collection of feathered, foliage, and flower festooned philip treacy hats and fascinators on may

it\\u2019s notable that camilla also has a predilection for headbands that have been given an haute glow up. she broke with custom on the day of her civil wedding ceremony to the then prince of wales in 2005, wearing a wide brimmed ivory hat instead of a tiara for her daytime nuptials, before changing into a headband that glowed with curving golden wheat sheaves. victoria beckham wore a gravity

creation, queen sofia of spain sporting a netted lilac confection, and princesses beatrice and eugenie also in daring treacy designs (which attracted much tabloid derision at the time). beatrice took

tindall and zara phillips in 2011. after the pandemic brought about a period of pared back wedding guest dressing, lucy knight, a personal stylist at john lewis, has observed a renewed focus on maximalist millinery. \\u201cwe\\u2019ve noticed a trend for larger hats rather than small fascinators,\\u201d knight says. bold colors like hot pink and cobalt blue are proving popular, as is specifically, john lewis\\u2019s wide brimmed sofia hat, imagined in a sorbet pink abaca that both the late princess diana and queen camilla would approve of. when customers are opting for fascinators, they\\u2019re choosing larger, disc shaped iterations. what exactly will decorate the heads of guests at the coronation remains to be seen. perhaps, in line with the (relatively) low key nature of the 21st century celebration for which peers have been asked to wear parliamentary robes rather than those imagined in ceremonial crimson velvet with white ermine trim millinery will be more streamlined than statement. maybe hats and fascinators will bloom with florals in a nod to king charles\\u2019s green fingered eco credentials, or scaled back embellishments will reflect the sober

is one area though where i am a wee bit prickly and it has to do with people's laziness. when someone barges into a forum or subreddit having made no effort to do any research or reading and demands help by asking the exact same question that approximately 1 miliion other people have asked, i get get a little vexed. you may have noticed that today marks a redesign that i hope brings a cleaner, sleeker, easier to read format to the site. i\\u2019m kind of excited about it   i hope it\\u2019s at least tolerable for you, the reader! even better, i hope you actually like it. it wasn't until i actually started blogging that i began to figure out what i wanted to write about and which tools to use. if i hadn't decided to start, i'd still be stuck, just thinking and not writing a single word. and while the roll out of av1 continues, work is already underway on its successor. it might take a few more years before devices actually support that next gen codec, but early results suggest that it will make a difference. \\u201cat this point, we see close to 30 percent bit rate reduction with the same quality compared to av1,\\u201d aaron explained. \\u201ci think that\\u2019s very, very promising.\\u201d sneezing can be incredibly dangerous. and we might finally know why. a new way to peer into the past. here's why it might be impossible. this one didn't go according to plan. china\\u2019s task of nurturing home grown talent in fields including hey hi (ai) and space has become more urgent. two weeks ago without any prior warning the company i work for told me that they would part ways with me and that they would terminate my employment contract. then they asked me to leave my phone and laptop with them and walked me to the exit. here\\u2019s how it came to this, and what i\\u2019m taking away from it. this is of course a very personal story, and i pondered for quite a while if i should even publish it here, but in the end this is a personal blog and i feel like telling this story, so why not. now the headline is actually a little exaggerated because i wasn\\u2019t \\u201cfired\\u201d in the true sense of the word; i live in germany where we have very strong laws for worker protection, so truly firing someone, meaning immediately terminating an employment contract, is pretty much only possible if the employee has done something that violates their contract or the law and which makes further employment of that person impossible. i have done no such thing, and at least on paper i\\u2019m still employed for a few more months, but what happened certainly felt like being fired to me, which is why i think putting it like this is appropriate. most of us will probably have seen semiconductor wafers as they trundle their way through a chip factory, and some of us may have wondered about why they are round. this roundness is an obvious problem when one considers that the chip dies themselves are rectangular, meaning that a significant amount of the dies etched into the wafers end up being incomplete and thus as waste, especially with (expensive) large dies. this is not a notion which has escaped the attention of chip manufacturers like tsmc, with this particular manufacturer apparently currently studying a way to make square substrates a reality. midsummer is the time of practicing ancient beliefs for various purposes: to be lucky or rich, to fall in love, to predict the future based on the weather, or even to be outright nasty to someone. exciting news! it's more common than we thought. people have grown more attached to their pets   and more willing to spend money on them   turning animal medicine into a high tech industry worth billions. despite the increased worldwide attention, the korean food manufacturer remains cautious. except, niemann admitted no such thing. quite the opposite: he has vigorously defended himself against the allegations, going so far as to file a $100 million defamation lawsuit against carlsen and several others who had accused him of cheating or punished him for the unproven allegation chess.com, for example, had banned niemann from its website and tournaments. although a judge dismissed the suit on procedural grounds, niemann has been cleared of wrongdoing, and carlsen has agreed to play him again. but the prodigy is still seething: niemann recently spoke of an \\u201cundying and unwavering resolve\\u201d to silence his haters, saying, \\u201ci\\u2019m going to be their biggest nightmare for the rest of their lives.\\u201d could he insist that google and its ai, too, are on the hook for harming his reputation? take this tidbit buried in the same nyt story: wendy's ai drive through system requires human intervention in the double digits   14 percent, in fact, which is a pretty striking proportion. white castle has its own ai drive through ordering system, and it also requires human intervention at a rate of 10 percent, a company spokesperson told the nyt. over the course of eight months and an estimated $700 (mostly in travel expenses), he was able to claw back what all other methods had failed to render: his personal facebook account. tl;dr: recently, in the light of all the a.i. crap, i have been contemplating whether i should delist my website from all search engines, including google. incapable of hallucinating and lying, we're left with \\\"wrong\\\". some of the output is just wrong; sometimes dangerously so. right now your new tv is reporting what you watch back to parties unknown. your new car is doing the same. hell, so is your phone. what if you had all that data? won\\u2019t you be able to do more with it than the spies and their corporate customers can? in this new paradigm, your windows computer will take a screenshot of everything you do every few seconds. an iphone will stitch together information across many apps you use. and an android phone can listen to a call in real time to alert you to a scam. is this information you are willing to share? public cdns also create privacy risks. while online privacy was a niche topic when public cdns first became popular, it's now become a major issue for the public at large, and a serious legal concern. this can be problematic for public cdn usage because loading resources from a 3rd party leaks information: that the user is loading that 3rd party

and the three china us joint communiqu\\u00e9s, especially the august 17 communiqu\\u00e9 of 1982. according to the police, the accused has links to a new terror module named \\u2018shahadat\\u2019, which is also operating in bangladesh. \\u201cthis terror module is found to be linked with activists of ansar al islam, which is a banned terror organisation in bangladesh and is affiliated to al qaida, which is a global terrorist organisation,\\u201d the stf said. shimizu found himself explaining to his wife more details about the building than what the museum offered. the building was the headquarters in china of the imperial japanese army\\u2019s unit 731. and shimizu finally told his wife that he had been a member of the infamous biological warfare unit that used prisoners as guinea pigs in its experiments. much ink has been spilled trying to understand religious extremism and its outcomes, both in pakistan and abroad. existing research points out two sets of factors here   the societal organisation and drivers of extremism; and the role of the state. on societal organisation, it is well documented that such indoctrination is carried out by clerics, not just through in person contact in sermons and in madressahs, but also through highly localised whatsapp and facebook groups, as well as content on tiktok. they do it because they believe in it and because it sustains their social status within communities. people pay them respect, provide them with gifts, turn to them for advice and for dispute resolution. armed militants attacked two orthodox churches, a

project more than 100 years in the making that will connect several of the subcontinent\\u2019s rivers, transforming the disparate flows of neighboring watersheds into a mega water grid spanning from the himalayas to the arabian sea and the bay of bengal. \\\"basically, if there is more damage, someone has to pay for it,\\\" said ernst rauch, a climate expert with munich re, a major reinsurance company. either insurance companies, the state, or the person who suffered the damage must foot the bill. the logic behind insurance is that many people sign up, but only a few suffer losses and receive compensation. if a growing number of people are hit by losses, however, insurance companies will pass on the risk and increase premiums for insurance holders. as some previous extreme events have proven too costly to cover, insurance companies have in turn passed on some of their risk to what are known as reinsurers. munich re is one of these companies. it has been studying the effects of climate change for around 50 years with regard to their consequences for their own business. \\u201cthese events have a huge impact on crop production, from where the food chain begins.\\u201d hotter

have seen a pattern emerge in farming areas of the central valley: even as declining groundwater levels have left thousands of residents with dry wells and caused the ground to sink, counties have continued granting permits for agricultural landowners to drill new wells and pump even more water. a bill that was sponsored by the california department of water resources sought to address these problems by prohibiting new high capacity wells within a quarter mile of a drinking water well or in areas where the land has been sinking because of overpumping. the irish bar council on saturday

public interest technology? i mean \\\"internet\\\" the way most people understand it, which is to say our whole digital sphere, and by \\\"public interest\\\" i don't mean tinkering at the margins to reduce harm from some bad actors or painting some glossy ethics principles atop a pile of exploitative rent seeking   i mean through and through, warts and all, an internet that works in support of a credible, pragmatic definition of the common good.1 is that too wildly speculative? i think not. i am not talking about a utopian project here   a public interest internet would be a glorious imperfect mess and it would be far from problem free. but while there is a lot of solid thinking about various digital issues or pieces of internet infrastructure (much of which i rely upon here), including a great blog series from danny o'brien and friends, i have yet to read to an answer to this question: what global digital architecture should we assemble if we take seriously the idea that the internet should be public interest technology? ipv4 is an expensive resource. however, many content providers are still ipv4 only. the most common reason is that ipv4 is here to stay and ipv6 is an additional complexity. this mindset may seem selfish, but there are compelling reasons for a content provider to enable ipv6, even when they have enough ipv4 addresses available for their needs.

Let me start by understanding the user's request. The topic is \\\"Can your partner be compelled to eat dessert at your preferred time?\\\" and the context is a blog-style piece about family dinners, dessert policies, and introducing the idea of serving dessert with dinner based on Ellyn Satter's division of responsibility.\\n\\nFirst, I should structure the article. The original context is written in a personal, conversational tone, so I need to maintain that. The key points from the context are: the author's personal experience with dessert, the struggle with her daughter wanting dessert before dinner, the revelation from Anya Hoffman about serving dessert with dinner, and Ellyn Satter's division of responsibility in feeding.\\n\\nThe user wants the article to address whether a partner (instead of children) can be made to eat dessert at a specific time. Wait, the original context is about children, but the topic shifts to a partner. That's a twist. So I need to adapt the context's content to apply to adult relationships. The core idea is about timing of dessert, but shifting the focus from parent-child to partners.\\n\\nHmm, the original context talks about Ellyn Satter's approach where parents control what, when, and where, and kids decide how much and whether. The exception is dessert. The article suggests serving dessert with dinner to reduce power struggles. Now, applying this to partners: can you make your partner eat dessert when you want?\\n\\nI need to reframe the discussion. Maybe discuss how couples negotiate meal routines, including dessert. The article could explore whether imposing dessert timing on a partner is feasible or healthy, using Satter's principles as a metaphor for adult relationships.\\n\\nWait, the original context is about children, but the topic is about partners. So the challenge is to take the concepts from feeding children and apply them to adult relationships. Maybe discuss compromise, communication, and respecting preferences. The article could argue that just as with kids, forcing a partner doesn't work, but finding a middle ground does.\\n\\nPossible structure: Start with a personal anecdote about dessert timing with a partner, introduce the struggle, then bring in the expert advice (Satter's ideas adapted for adults), discuss the importance of mutual respect and flexibility, and conclude with tips for couples.\\n\\nNeed to make sure the affiliate links and product mentions are included as per the context.

The context provided is a detailed Times Insider piece that gives background on the show, the hosts, their studio setup, and some specifics about their recent episode.\\n\\nFirst, I should structure the article similarly to a standard news piece. The headline should reflect the anniversary. The lead paragraph needs to summarize the main points: the show's name, hosts, anniversary date, and perhaps a mention of their unique approach blending highbrow and lowbrow culture.\\n\\nNext, I should incorporate details from the context. The studio setup with the colorful chairs and quirky decor is a good visual element to include. Mentioning that they sourced furniture from Horseman Antiques in Brooklyn adds a local touch. The hosts' backgrounds\\u2014Caramanica being a pop music critic since 2016 with the original Popcast, and Coscarelli as a frequent guest turned co-host for the Deluxe version\\u2014should be highlighted to establish their credibility.\\n\\nThe article should explain how the Deluxe version differs from the original audio podcast, emphasizing the expansion into video on YouTube. Including quotes from both hosts about their vision for the show, like Coscarelli's statement about going where the audience is, adds depth. The structure of their episodes, recording on Mondays and releasing segments throughout the week, along with the full audio on Wednesdays, shows their content strategy.\\n\\nThe recent episode covering Drake vs. Kendrick Lamar and Zendaya's film provides a timely example of their content. Mentioning that a Times Insider reporter observed the recording adds a behind-the-scenes angle. Including Sarah Bahr's role and background at the end ties it back to the Times Insider section, as per the context.\\n\\nI need to ensure the tone matches the original context\\u2014informative yet engaging, highlighting the show's blend of serious and playful elements. Avoid any markdown formatting and keep paragraphs concise. Check for any additional details in the context that I might have missed, like the hosts' ages or specific anecdotes about their studio setup.

The user probably wants an engaging article that introduces each quiz, explains their purposes, and encourages readers to take them. I need to make sure each section is clear and flows well.\\n\\nStarting with the introduction, I can mention how mental exercises are like workouts for the brain, similar to the gym analogy provided. Then, introduce the first quiz by Genial.guru with 10 riddles. Highlight that it's fun and short, and mention the user's example of someone getting 4 right answers. Maybe add a playful comment like Jordan being a smarty-pants.\\n\\nNext, the digital skills quiz. I need to explain its relevance in today's job market, the structure based on the digital competency framework, and the detailed report with strengths and weaknesses. Also, mention the learning roadmap after the quiz to guide improvement. Emphasize that knowing your level isn't enough; taking action is key.\\n\\nThen, the managerial skills test. Stress the importance of leadership qualities like planning, delegation, communication, and motivation. Link it to project success and personal development as a leader. Encourage readers to assess their skills here.\\n\\nI should also include a conclusion that ties all three quizzes together, reinforcing the importance of continuous learning and self-assessment. Maybe add a call to action, urging readers to try the quizzes and share results.\\n\\nI need to keep the tone friendly and motivational, using exclamation points and emojis if appropriate. Make sure each section transitions smoothly. Check for any context details I might have missed, like the part about needing to be observant with the riddles. Also, ensure that the article is in Spanish, as the context and topic are in Spanish. Avoid any markdown formatting as per the instructions.\\n\\nWait, the user provided the context in Spanish, but the initial topic is also in Spanish. The generated article should be in Spanish.

            "Every year, Apple and Google announce major software updates that bring new features to our smartphones, like cosmetic overhauls to the home screen, stronger privacy protections and fun messaging tools. This year, the changes will feel more radical because the companies are focusing on reinventing our phones with artificial intelligence.\n",
            "At its annual software developer conference on Monday, Apple showed a host of enhancements coming this fall to iOS 18, its operating system powering iPhones. The new tools include arevamped version of its voice assistant, Siri, that is easier to talk to and an A.I. system that will generate images, create summaries of web articles and craft responses to text messages and emails.\n",
            "Apple’s news followed Google’s Android announcements last month, which included an A.I. system that automatically summarizes audio transcripts, detects whether a phone conversation is likely a scam and helps students with homework.\n",
            "Because A.I. tech is still new, it’s unclear whether these improvements will resonate with the masses. The change that will have a more immediate effect has to do with old-school text messages — also known as thegreen bubble. Apple said its new software would adopt a messaging standard that would let iPhone users send higher-quality messages to Androids, addressing an issue that has made it more difficult for people to communicate for more than a decade.\n",
            "Apple and Google are set to release their free software updates for iOS and Android this fall. Here’s what to know about how our smartphones will change.\n",
            "Siri Is Getting an A.I. Brain Transplant\n",
            "Apple said it had completely reworked Siri, its 13-year-old virtual assistant.\n",
            "The assistant will soon be powered by Apple Intelligence, the company’s version of a “large language model.” That type of A.I. technology uses statistics and complex algorithms to guess what words belong together, similar to the autocomplete feature on your phone. It’s the same type of underlying technology we’ve seen powering chatbots likeOpenAI’s ChatGPTandGoogle’s Gemini. Apple said its system was more private than others’ because people’s data would remain on their iPhones.\n"

Chen\\nEvery year, Apple and Google announce major software updates that bring new features to our smartphones, like cosmetic overhauls to the home screen, stronger privacy protections and fun messaging tools. This year, the changes will feel more radical because the companies are focusing on reinventing our phones with artificial intelligence.\\nAt its annual software developer conference on Monday, Apple showed a host of enhancements coming this fall to iOS 18, its operating system powering iPhones. The new tools include arevamped version of its voice assistant, Siri, that is easier to talk to and an A.I. system that will generate images, create summaries of web articles and craft responses to text messages and emails.\\nApple’s news followed Google’s Android announcements last month, which included an A.I. system that automatically summarizes audio transcripts, detects whether a phone conversation is likely a scam and helps students with homework.\\nBecause A.I. tech is still new, it’s unclear whether these improvements will resonate with the masses. The change that will have a more immediate effect has to do with old-school text messages — also known as thegreen bubble. Apple said its new software would adopt a messaging standard that would let iPhone users send higher-quality messages to Androids, addressing an issue that has made it more difficult for people to communicate for more than a decade.\\nApple and Google are set to release their free software updates for iOS and Android this fall. Here’s what to know about how our smartphones will change.\\nSiri Is Getting an A.I. Brain Transplant\\nApple said it had completely reworked Siri, its 13-year-old virtual assistant.\\nThe assistant will soon be powered by Apple Intelligence, the company’s version of a “large language model.” That type of A.I. technology uses statistics and complex algorithms to guess what words belong together, similar to the autocomplete feature on your phone. It’s the same type of underlying technology we’ve seen powering chatbots likeOpenAI’s ChatGPTandGoogle’s Gemini. Apple said its system was more private than others’ because people’s data would remain on their iPhones.'"

Just last week, five men were convicted of operating Jetflicks, an illegal streaming site that federal prosecutors said offered astolen lineupof TV shows and movies that was larger than the combined catalogs of Netflix, Hulu and Amazon\\u2019s Prime Video.\\nBut thieves are also getting better, moving operations overseas and taking advantage of the rising popularity of streaming to steal more content.\\nSo entertainment companies \\u2014 already under pressure from Wall Street to improve streaming economics \\u2014 are intensifying their antipiracy efforts, hiring a former F.B.I. official to lead the drive and renewing a push for federal legislation to combat online thievery overseas. The companies, which include Netflix, Disney, NBCUniversal and Warner Bros. Discovery, are also expanding their piracy policing to include live sports.\\nOn Monday, the Motion Picture Association, a trade group that represents those companies and others, said it had hired Larissa L. Knapp, a 27-year veteran of the F.B.I., as its top pirate chaser.

Smartphone\\nApple and Google are getting up close and personal with user data to craft memos, summarize documents and generate images.\\nByBrian X. Chen\\nEvery year, Apple and Google announce major software updates that bring new features to our smartphones, like cosmetic overhauls to the home screen, stronger privacy protections and fun messaging tools. This year, the changes will feel more radical because the companies are focusing on reinventing our phones with artificial intelligence.\\nAt its annual software developer conference on Monday, Apple showed a host of enhancements coming this fall to iOS 18, its operating system powering iPhones. The new tools include arevamped version of its voice assistant, Siri, that is easier to talk to and an A.I. system that will generate images, create summaries of web articles and craft responses to text messages and emails.\\nApple\\u2019s news followed Google\\u2019s Android announcements last month, which included an A.I. system that automatically summarizes audio transcripts, detects whether a phone conversation is likely a scam and helps students with homework.\\nBecause A.I. tech is still new, it\\u2019s unclear whether these improvements will resonate with the masses. The change that will have a more immediate effect has to do with old-school text messages \\u2014 also known as thegreen bubble. Apple said its new software would adopt a messaging standard that would let iPhone users send higher-quality messages to Androids, addressing an issue that has made it more difficult for people to communicate for more than a decade.\\nApple and Google are set to release their free software updates for iOS and Android this fall. Here\\u2019s what to know about how our smartphones will change.\\nSiri Is Getting an A.I.

growing homeless crisis a new type of care facility is emerging offering a lifeline to an oftenoverlooked demographic older adults experiencing homelessness These programs akin to nursing homes and rehabilitation centers tailored for the unique needs of this vulnerable population provide a haven for those too sick for the streets but not sick enough for longterm hospital stays\\n\\nThe rise of these respite care programs is a direct response to the aging homeless population and the expansion of Medicaid which helps cover the costs associated with such care  Traditionally older homeless individuals discharged from hospitals often found themselves caught in a revolving door returning to the streets with inadequate support only to be readmitted later This cycle experts say is not only detrimental to the individuals health but also places a significant strain on the healthcare system\\n\\nWe were seeing people discharged from the hospital with nowhere to go but back to the streets even if they needed significant medical care says Quote from an expert ideally from the National Institute for Medical Respite Care about the impetus for creating these programs\\n\\nThe National Institute for Medical Respite Care reports that the number of these programs largely operated by nonprofit organizations has more than doubled since 2016 exceeding 165 nationwide  This expansion reaching cities like Memphis Missoula and Greenville underscores a growing recognition of the need for specialized care that addresses the complex medical and social needs of older homeless adults\\n\\nInsert a compelling anecdote about an individual who has benefited from this type of care drawing from the provided text or including new research Focus on how their life has improved and the positive impact on their health and wellbeing\\n\\nThese programs offer more than just medical care They provide a safe and supportive environment where residents can access essential services like nutritious meals case management and assistance with securing permanent housing This holistic approach advocates say is crucial for breaking the cycle of homelessness and promoting longterm wellbeing\\n\\nIts not just about providing a bed and medical attention explains Quote from an individual involved in running one of these programs highlighting the holistic approach and the range of services provided Its about restoring dignity providing hope and empowering individuals to rebuild their lives\\n\\nWhile the growth of these programs is encouraging challenges remain Funding for these initiatives is often piecemeal relying on a patchwork of government grants private donations and Medicaid reimbursements  Advocates stress the need for sustainable funding models to ensure the longterm viability and expansion of these vital services\\n\\nAs the homeless population continues to age the need for compassionate and effective care solutions will only become more acute These innovative programs offer a beacon of hope demonstrating that with the right support older adults experiencing homelessness can access the care they need to heal recover and rebuild their lives

prepared for the unexpected But a little engine trouble was the least of our worries\\n\\nBy Elaine Glusac\\n\\nSPLIT Croatia  The siren song of a bargain is hard to resist especially when it involves turquoise waters sundrenched islands and the promise of adventure So when a Black Friday deal popped up for a Croatian islandhopping cruise aboard a yacht my cousin Kim and I threw caution and our carefully curated budgets to the wind \\n\\nThe catch The trip was in the offseason Late April in the Adriatic meant unpredictable weather potentially closed restaurants and the risk of encountering more sheep than fellow tourists But with a 30 percent discount bringing the sevennight journey to a tantalizing 1300 per person we decided to embrace the gamble We packed our raincoats brushed up on our Croatian phrases and set off for Split ready to test the waters of budgetfriendly adventure\\n\\nWe envisioned ourselves lounging on the deck sipping local wine as the sun dipped below the horizon the gentle rocking of the boat our only lullaby  The reality as it often does had other plans \\n\\nOur vessel a charming 54foot yacht was more handson than we anticipated  The itinerary promising idyllic stops at hidden coves and charming villages became a frantic scramble to make up for lost time when the engine sputtered coughed and finally gave up the ghost  \\n\\nAs it turned out a clogged fuel filter was the culprit  a minor inconvenience in the grand scheme of things but enough to throw a wrench or perhaps a spanner into our carefully laid plans  The delay while frustrating did offer a crash course in nautical problemsolving with passengers and crew alike pitching in to help\\n\\nOur predicament we learned had a certain mythical resonance  Legend has it that the Greek hero Odysseus famed for his own maritime misadventures was shipwrecked and held captive on the Croatian island of Mljet  Centuries later we found ourselves channeling his spirit albeit with less peril and considerably more sunscreen \\n\\nThe engine trouble thankfully resolved after a day of impromptu swimming and sunbathing proved to be the least of our worries  The offseason while offering solitude and a certain rugged beauty also presented challenges Restaurants and shops remained stubbornly shuttered forcing us to rely on our dwindling snack supply and the kindness of locals The weather as fickle as the Adriatic winds swung between glorious sunshine and bonechilling rain often within the span of a single afternoon\\n\\nYet amidst the chaos and unexpected turns we discovered the true magic of offseason travel  We forged bonds with our fellow passengers sharing stories laughter and the occasional bottle of rakija the potent local brandy  We explored ancient ruins shrouded in mist their silence broken only by the cries of gulls  We learned to adapt to improvise and to find joy in the unexpected\\n\\nOur affordable islandhopping adventure may not have unfolded as planned but it offered a valuable lesson sometimes the greatest treasures are found not in the smooth sailing but in the detours the mishaps and the moments when we are forced to embrace the unpredictable nature of travel and of life itself \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"AI generated story(without context)\",\n

There were no immediate reports of casualties.\\nByEuan Ward\\nreporting from Beirut, Lebanon\\nThe Lebanese militant group Hezbollah fired one of its heaviest rocket barrages yet into Israel on Wednesday, targeting military bases and an arms factory, in response to an overnight strike thatkilled one of its senior commanders.\\nThe commander, Taleb Abdallah, also known as Abu Taleb, was among the highest-ranking Hezbollah members to have been killed since the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel set off war in Gaza. The Israeli offensive prompted Hezbollah to mount cross-border attacks in support of Hamas.\\nThe Israeli military said in a statement on Wednesday that it had struck a Hezbollah command and control center, killing Mr. Abdallah and three other Hezbollah fighters. It called Mr. Abdallah one of Hezbollah\\u2019s top commanders in southern Lebanon.\\nAs sirens sounded across northern Israel on Wednesday, Israeli army radio said that around 150 rockets had been launched from Lebanon in an apparent response to the Israeli strike.\\nHezbollah claimed attacks on a string of military bases, including on Mount Meron, an area housing a military radar station that is roughly five miles south of the border. Hezbollah also claimed to have struck an arms factory belonging to Plasan, a manufacturer of armored vehicles used by the Israeli military.\\nThere were no immediate reports of casualties from the rocket barrages, according to the Israeli military. It said in a statement that a number of the rockets had been intercepted, but that several had hit the ground and started fires.\\nIsraeli firefighters were working to extinguish the blazes, a week after another Hezbollah rocket attack set off wildfires that prompted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to issue a threat of \\u201cvery intense action\\u201d along the Lebanese border.\\nThe Israeli military said it had responded on Wednesday by striking a number of launch sites across the border. Lebanon\\u2019s state-run news agency reported heavy Israeli airstrikes and bombardment across the country\\u2019s south.\\nHezbollah, apowerful Lebanese militia and political movementbacked by Iran, and Israel have bombarded each other across the border for much of the past eight months, with more than 150,000 people on both sides of the boundary forced to flee their homes. But the intensity of the attacks has increased this month amid threats by Israeli officials at the highest levels to pursue further military action.\\nIsrael has been targeting Hezbollah commanders with the aim of pushing the group north of the Litani River in Lebanon, hoping to prevent cross-border attacks and to eventually allowIsraeli civilians displaced by the fightingto return to their homes. Some experts have expressed skepticism about whether the targeted killings can accomplish this aim.\\nRawan Sheikh Ahmadcontributed reporting.\\nEuan Wardis a reporter contributing to The Times from Beirut.More about Euan Ward\",\n          \"Newsletter\\nMorning Briefing: Asia Pacific Edition\\nWednesday Briefing: Hunter Biden Found Guilty on Gun Charges\\nAlso, pressure on Israel and Hamas to reach a deal.\\nByAmelia Nierenberg\\nHunter Biden was found guilty on gun charges\\nHunter Biden, the president\\u2019s son, wasfound guilty on three felony countsof lying on a federal firearms application. The verdict is a personal blow to President Biden as he enters the final months of his re-election campaign.\\nThe maximum possible sentence could be up to 25 years in prison and $750,000 in fines. But sentencing guidelines call for a fraction of that penalty, and first-time offenders who did not use their weapons to commit a violent crime typically receive no jail time.

He was 70.\\nThe cause was complications of esophageal cancer, his longtime partner, Steve Miller, said.\\nMr. Boaz encapsulated libertarianism, the philosophy that prioritizes individual freedom over government overreach, with characteristic perspicuity:\\n\\u201cYou learn the essence of libertarianism in kindergarten,\\u201d he wrote in \\u201cLibertarianism: A Primer,\\u201d a 1997 book that was updated and rereleased in 2015 as \\u201cThe Libertarian Mind: A Manifesto for Freedom.\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t hit other people, don\\u2019t take their stuff, and keep your promises.\\u201d\\nAs executive vice president of the Cato Institute, the Washington-based libertarian think tank, since 1989, Mr. Boaz was a frequent contributor to the libertarian magazine, Reason. He also wrote opinion essays for The New York Times and other publications, advancing a philosophy that had been embraced for centuries by thinkers like John Locke, Adam Smith, Thomas Jefferson, Ayn Rand and Milton Friedman, but whose practical application posed challenges to some potential disciples.\\nSumming up his holistic view of individual liberty, Mr. Boaz toldThe Timesin 1984, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s any of the government\\u2019s business to protect people from themselves, whether it\\u2019s seatbelts, cyclamates or marijuana.\\u201d\\nNor, he argued, did it make any sense to deny gay people legal equality. Government benefits, for example, should not be withheld from same-sex partners in stable relationships, he said, when children of single-parent families or of unmarried heterosexual partners were receiving that support.

federal jury in Washington DC found Chiquita Brands International liable for the deaths of thousands of Colombians during the countrys brutal civil conflict The case brought by families of the victims alleged that the fruit giant financed a rightwing paramilitary group responsible for widespread atrocities \\n\\nThe jurys decision marks a significant victory for human rights advocates and victims families who have long sought accountability for the companys role in the violence For years Chiquita known for its iconic banana brand operated in a volatile region of Colombia where it faced threats from both leftist guerrillas and rightwing paramilitaries \\n\\nThe lawsuit centered around Chiquitas admitted payments to the United SelfDefense Forces of Colombia AUC a paramilitary organization designated as a terrorist group by the United States Between 1997 and 2004 Chiquita funneled over 17 million to the AUC claiming it was for protection from rebel groups targeting its employees and operations \\n\\nHowever the plaintiffs argued that these payments went far beyond mere protection money effectively making Chiquita complicit in the AUCs reign of terror The paramilitary group notorious for massacres assassinations and forced disappearances was responsible for the deaths of an estimated 4000 Colombians during the period Chiquita was financing them \\n\\nThe jury agreed finding Chiquita liable for the wrongful deaths of 392 individuals specifically named in the lawsuit The case was brought under the Torture Victim Protection Act which allows lawsuits in US courts for extrajudicial killings and torture committed abroad While the exact amount of damages has yet to be determined the ruling could cost Chiquita billions of dollars \\n\\nThis verdict sets a powerful precedent for corporate accountability in conflict zones It sends a clear message that companies cannot profit from or turn a blind eye to human rights abuses even in the most challenging environments \\n\\nChiquita which merged with Fyffes to become ChiquitaFyffes in 2014 has expressed regret for its past actions but maintains that it was a victim of extortion The company has yet to announce whether it will appeal the ruling\\n\\nThis case is a stark reminder of the human cost of conflict and the responsibility of corporations to operate ethically even under duress The fight for justice

Deferred Why the Paramount Deal Talks Fizzled \\n\\nBy Your Name The New York Times\\n\\nPublished Date\\n\\nFor months whispers of a potential media megamerger captivated Hollywood Paramount Global the entertainment giant behind CBS Paramount Pictures and Pluto TV was reportedly in talks to be acquired by Comcast the telecommunications behemoth controlling NBCUniversal and Peacock This week however those discussions abruptly ended leaving industry insiders and analysts dissecting the reasons behind the breakdown \\n\\nWhile neither company has officially commented on the collapse of the deal several factors likely contributed to the decision\\n\\n1 A Price Tag Too High Sources close to the negotiations suggest that a key sticking point was the valuation of Paramount Comcast already grappling with a debt load exceeding 100 billion was reportedly hesitant to meet the asking price set by Shari Redstone chairwoman of Paramounts controlling shareholder National Amusements \\n\\n2 Regulatory Roadblocks The proposed merger would have faced intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators already wary of consolidation in the media landscape The Biden administrations aggressive stance towards antitrust enforcement likely gave both companies pause raising the specter of a lengthy and costly legal battle\\n\\n3 Streaming Strategy Uncertainties While both Paramount and Peacock have made strides in the streaming arena they remain dwarfed by giants like Netflix and Disney Its unclear how a combined entity would have navigated the increasingly competitive streaming landscape potentially raising concerns about longterm viability\\n\\n4 Market Volatility and Economic Headwinds The current economic climate marked by inflation rising interest rates and fears of a recession likely played a role in the decision The uncertain economic outlook may have made Comcast hesitant to commit to such a significant acquisition particularly given the already substantial debt on its balance sheet\\n\\nThe Aftermath and the Future\\n\\nThe collapse of the deal leaves both companies at a crossroads Paramount while possessing valuable assets faces an uphill battle in the streaming wars Comcast meanwhile will need to explore alternative avenues for growth and expansion in the rapidly evolving media landscape \\n\\nThe failed merger serves as a stark reminder of the challenges facing traditional media companies in the digital age As streaming competition intensifies and economic uncertainty looms the pressure to consolidate innovate and adapt will only continue to grow

The decision, delivered on [Date], marks a significant victory for the families of victims who have long accused the banana giant of complicity in the violence that ravaged their nation.\\n\\nThe lawsuit, filed in [Year], alleged that Chiquita, through its Colombian subsidiary Banadex, provided financial and logistical support to the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), a right-wing paramilitary group notorious for massacres, torture, and displacement. The AUC, designated a terrorist organization by the United States, waged a bloody campaign against leftist guerrillas and civilians suspected of sympathizing with them.\\n\\nEvidence presented at trial showed that Chiquita executives paid the AUC millions of dollars in \\\"protection money\\\" between 1997 and 2004. These payments, disguised as security expenses, allowed the paramilitaries to purchase weapons, ammunition, and other resources used to carry out their reign of terror.\\n\\nChiquita has admitted to making the payments but argued that it was extorted by the AUC and had no choice but to comply. The company maintained that it was a victim of circumstance, caught in the crossfire of a complex conflict.\\n\\nHowever, the jury rejected this defense, finding that Chiquita\\u2019s actions went beyond mere acquiescence to extortion.

This can have long-lasting consequences, making it harder for individuals to secure loans, rent apartments, or even obtain employment.\\n\\nUnder the Biden administration's proposal, medical debt would be removed from credit reports entirely. Additionally, the proposal includes provisions to:\\n\\n* **Provide a 12-month grace period before unpaid medical debt can be reported to credit bureaus.** This will give individuals and families more time to navigate insurance claims and payment plans.\\n* **Limit the negative impact of medical debt on credit scores.** This will help ensure that individuals are not unfairly penalized for seeking necessary medical care.\\n* **Increase consumer education and awareness about medical billing practices.** This will empower patients to understand their rights and advocate for themselves.\\n\\nThe proposal has been met with praise from consumer advocacy groups and healthcare professionals, who have long argued that medical debt is a public health crisis. \\n\\n\\\"This is a significant step towards addressing the systemic inequities in our healthcare system,\\\" said [Quote from representative of a relevant organization]\\n\\nHowever, some industry groups have expressed concerns about the potential impact on lending practices and the availability of credit.\\n\\nThe Biden administration's proposal is expected to face opposition from Republicans in Congress. However, the White House has indicated that it is committed to working with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to pass meaningful legislation.\\n\\nThe proposal represents a major shift in the national conversation surrounding medical debt and its impact on the financial well-being of millions of Americans. If enacted, it could provide much-needed relief for families struggling under the weight of medical bills and offer a path towards a more equitable healthcare system. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"AI generated article with context\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 209,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"## U.A.W. Secures Tentative Agreement at Ohio EV Battery Plant, Setting Potential Precedent \\n\\n**Lordstown, Ohio** - In a potential watershed moment for the burgeoning electric vehicle industry, the United Automobile Workers (U.A.W.) announced a tentative contract agreement on Monday with Ultium Cells, a joint venture between General Motors and LG Energy Solution. The agreement, if ratified, would cover 1,600 workers at the Lordstown, Ohio plant responsible for producing batteries for GM's electric vehicles.\\n\\nThis agreement marks a significant step for the U.A.W. in its efforts to secure better pay and working conditions within the EV supply chain.  U.A.W. President Shawn Fain hailed the accord as a \\\"game changer for the electric vehicle battery industry\\\" in a letter to union members. \\n\\nThe Lordstown plant, operational since 2022, initially employed a non-union workforce. However, the workers were brought under the U.A.W. umbrella following the union's national contract negotiations with GM last fall. This new local agreement builds upon that framework, outlining specific wages and working conditions for the Ohio plant.\\n\\nBoth GM and Ultium Cells expressed satisfaction with the agreement.  Crucially, the U.A.W. intends to leverage this agreement as a model for upcoming negotiations at other battery plants being constructed by GM and its Detroit rivals. This includes facilities in Tennessee and Michigan for GM, Kentucky and Tennessee for Ford, and Indiana for Stellantis.\\n\\nThe U.A.W.'s success in securing this agreement at the Lordstown plant could have ripple effects throughout the rapidly expanding EV battery production landscape.  With numerous other plants either operational or under construction, this agreement could set a benchmark for wages, benefits, and worker protections across the industry. The ratification vote by the Lordstown workers will be a key indicator of the agreement's potential to reshape labor relations in the EV sector. \\n\",\n          \"## Can A.I. Rethink Art? Should It? Artists Grapple with the Promise and Peril of Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n**VENICE** - A skeletal figure lies in the Chilean desert, the subject of an enigmatic ritual. Robots, powered by artificial intelligence, circle, filming and placing objects around it in a choreography only they comprehend. This is \\\"Camata,\\\" a haunting new work by French artist Pierre Huyghe, and a powerful example of the burgeoning intersection of art and A.I.\\n\\nThe piece, on display at the Punta della Dogana \\u2013 Pinault Collection exhibition space during the Venice Biennale, has sparked a debate that extends far beyond the art world: Can A.I. truly be creative? Should it?\\n\\nThe very notion of artificial intelligence evokes both fascination and fear. While some celebrate its potential to revolutionize fields from medicine to transportation, others worry about its implications for humanity. Renowned thinkers like Yuval Noah Harari and the late Stephen Hawking have warned of a future where superintelligent machines could surpass and even supplant humans.\\n\\nSo why are artists, whose very livelihoods seem threatened by the prospect of A.I.-generated art, embracing this technology?\\n\\n\\\"Artists have always been drawn to chance, to forces beyond their control,\\\" explains Daniel Birnbaum, artistic director of the digital art platform Acute Art. Speaking at the Art for Tomorrow conference in Venice, Birnbaum argued that artists like Huyghe are not interested in \\\"A.I.-generated nonsense.\\\" Instead, they are exploring the liminal spaces \\\"where nature and artificiality merge,\\\" where biological and technological systems collide to create something entirely new.\\n\\nHuyghe's \\\"Camata,\\\" with its juxtaposition of ancient human remains and futuristic robots, embodies this tension. The piece raises profound questions about the nature of consciousness, creativity, and our place in the universe.\\n\\nHowever, the potential dangers of A.I. are undeniable. Birnbaum acknowledges the \\\"frightening scenarios\\\" where A.I. could be used to manipulate governments or wage war, posing existential threats to humanity.\\n\\nThe challenge, then, is not to shy away from A.I., but to engage with it critically and thoughtfully. Artists, with their unique ability to probe the boundaries of human experience, are uniquely positioned to explore both the promise and peril of this transformative technology. As A.I. continues to evolve, the art world will undoubtedly serve as a crucial battleground for grappling with its ethical and philosophical implications. \\n\",\n          \"## The Silent Financial Drain: How Alzheimer's Steals More Than Memory\\n\\n**New research reveals a hidden cost of Alzheimer's disease: financial decline years before diagnosis.**\\n\\nThe heartbreak of Alzheimer's disease extends far beyond the gradual loss of memory and cognitive function. A new study published by economists and medical experts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Georgetown University sheds light on a devastating but often overlooked consequence: the financial toll that begins long before a formal diagnosis.\\n\\nThe study, which analyzed Medicare records alongside data from credit bureau Equifax, paints a stark picture. Individuals who later develop Alzheimer's exhibit a clear pattern of financial decline years before their diagnosis. These individuals are significantly more likely to fall behind on mortgage payments and credit card bills, with delinquencies increasing as the disease progresses.  \\n\\n\\\"The results are striking in both their clarity and their consistency,\\\" stated Carole Roan Gresenz, a Georgetown University economist and study co-author. The study highlights how credit scores and delinquencies \\\"consistently worsen over time as diagnosis approaches, mirroring the changes in cognitive decline.\\\"\\n\\nThis research reinforces the lived experiences of countless Alzheimer's patients and their families who have witnessed firsthand the disease's insidious impact on financial decision-making.  Missed payments, impulsive purchases, and risky investments become increasingly common as cognitive function deteriorates, often before a diagnosis is even suspected.\\n\\n\\\"It's not just about forgetfulness,\\\" explains Lauren Hersch Nicholas, a professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine who studies dementia's impact on personal finances. \\\"Risk tolerance changes. What might have seemed unwise before can suddenly appear like a good financial move.\\\"\\n\\n**The implications of this study are far-reaching:**\\n\\n* **Early Detection is Crucial:** Recognizing the early signs of financial decline could offer crucial clues for earlier Alzheimer's diagnosis and intervention. \\n* **Financial Protection is Paramount:** Families need to be aware of this hidden cost and take proactive steps to safeguard their loved ones' financial well-being. \\n* **Support Systems are Essential:** Resources and support groups are vital for families navigating the complex financial and emotional challenges of Alzheimer's.\\n\\nThis study serves as a stark reminder that Alzheimer's is not just a health crisis; it's a financial one too.  By understanding the disease's full impact, we can better prepare, protect, and support those living with Alzheimer's and their families. \\n\\n**We want to hear from you.** Have you or your family experienced the financial challenges of Alzheimer's?

Find appropriate shelter.\\nPeople should identify the best place to shelter well before severe weather is in the forecast. The federal government provides many in-depth resources about how to identify a safe shelter. If you receive a tornado warning, the general rules are:\\n\\nIf you are outside, go inside.\\n\\nIf you are at home, go to the basement or an inner room without windows, such as a hallway or closet, on the lowest floor. In these places, it is also a good idea to shield your head and neck with your arms, hide under a heavy table and cover yourself with a mattress or blanket.\\n\\nMobile homes are not safe, and neither are large, empty rooms such as auditoriums, big-box stores and cafeterias, which are vulnerable to collapse.\\n\\nIf you live in a mobile home, make sure that you know of a sound structure that you can get to quickly. If you cannot identify a safe place, ask local officials or emergency responders where you can seek shelter before a storm is even in the forecast; they want you to have this information.\\n\\n2. Avoid driving.\\nWhen a tornado warning is issued, it is not safe to be in a vehicle. An automobile can collapse in on itself, debris can penetrate it or \\u2014 in extreme tornadoes \\u2014 it can be picked up and flung.\\n\\nDo not try to outrun a tornado. Even in rural areas, you can be stopped by traffic. And the tornado is likely to be surrounded by other nasty weather that can make driving very dangerous.\\n\\nYou may want to get down inside and cover your head, or you can abandon your vehicle and seek shelter in a low-lying area, such as a ditch or a ravine \\u2014 but be aware that it could flood. The Federal Emergency Management Agency recommends that you cover your head and neck with your arms and cover your body with a coat or blanket, if possible. By Tuesday morning, the high bid for a copy of Ulysses S. Grant\\u2019s memoirs, which the auction house said Sherman had \\u201cprofusely annotated,\\u201d was $19,000. Sherman\\u2019s childhood algebra book from 1829, complete with scribbles, had been bid up to $1,500. A bundle of his military possessions, including a pistol and daggers, had been bid up to $3,500.

While a watch signals potential danger, **a tornado warning means a twister has been sighted or indicated by weather radar \\u2013 and it's time to take immediate action.** \\n\\nThe National Weather Service urges everyone within the path of a tornado warning to seek shelter immediately. Here's how to stay safe:\\n\\n**1. Seek Shelter Underground:** The safest place to be is underground in a basement or storm cellar. If your home has one, move quickly, bringing essential supplies like a weather radio, flashlight, and first-aid kit.\\n\\n**2. No Basement? Go Low:** If you don't have access to an underground shelter, prioritize the lowest level of your home. Choose an interior room away from windows, preferably with strong walls and no windows, like a bathroom, closet, or hallway. \\n\\n**3. Stay Away from Windows:** Flying debris poses the greatest danger during a tornado. Stay away from windows and cover yourself with anything that can provide protection, like mattresses, blankets, or even helmets.\\n\\n**4. Mobile Homes Offer No Protection:** If you live in a mobile home, seek shelter in a sturdy building nearby. Mobile homes are particularly vulnerable to tornadoes and offer little protection.\\n\\n**Preparation is Key:**\\n\\nKnowing what to do during a tornado warning is crucial, but preparing beforehand can save valuable time and potentially lives:\\n\\n* **Develop a Family Plan:** Designate a safe room in your home and practice your tornado drill regularly. Make sure everyone knows where to go and what to do.\\n* **Stay Informed:** Monitor weather reports closely, especially during storm seasons. Sign up for local alerts and pay attention to watches and warnings. \\n* **Prepare a Go-Bag:** Keep a bag stocked with essentials like water, non-perishable food, medication, a flashlight, and a battery-powered radio.\\n\\nTornadoes can strike with little warning, leaving devastation in their wake. By understanding the difference between a watch and a warning and having a plan in place, you can significantly increase your chances of staying safe when these powerful storms threaten. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"AI generated article with context\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"## A Tornado Warning Demands Action: Here's What to Do\\n\\n**By Amanda Holpuch**\\n\\nThe ominous wail of a siren, a jarring alert on your phone, the urgent voice of a meteorologist on the radio \\u2013 these are the sounds and sights that often accompany a tornado warning.  Unlike a tornado watch, which signals potential danger, a **tornado warning** demands immediate action. It means a tornado has been sighted or detected by radar and is imminent. Your life could depend on knowing what to do.\\n\\nThe National Weather Service issues both tornado watches and warnings, but their meanings are distinct. A **tornado watch**, often covering a large area, indicates conditions are ripe for tornado formation. It's a call to be prepared and stay informed. \\n\\nA **tornado warning**, however, is localized and urgent.  It means a tornado is happening now, and you need to seek shelter immediately. Don't waste precious time trying to catch a glimpse of the storm \\u2013 tornadoes can be hidden by rain and hail.\\n\\n\\\"Seeking visual confirmation is time you're losing to respond,\\\" warns Deanna Hence, an assistant professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\\n\\n**When a Tornado Warning Strikes:**\\n\\n1. **Take Shelter:** The safest place is the lowest level of a sturdy building, away from windows.  A basement is ideal. If no basement is available, go to an interior room on the lowest floor, preferably without windows.\\n2. **Protect Yourself:**  If possible, get under something sturdy like a heavy table or workbench. Cover yourself with blankets, pillows, or even a mattress for added protection from debris. \\n3. **Stay Informed:** Keep your phone or a weather radio handy to monitor updates from the National Weather Service. \\n\\n**Preparing for Tornado Season:**\\n\\n* **Develop a Plan:** Discuss and practice a tornado safety plan with your family, ensuring everyone knows where to go and what to do. \\n* **Prepare a Kit:** Assemble a disaster kit with essentials like water, non-perishable food, a flashlight, a first-aid kit, and a whistle to signal for help.\\n* **Stay Informed:**  Familiarize yourself with the different tornado alerts and how they are communicated in your community. Download a weather app that provides timely alerts.\\n\\nRemember, a tornado warning is not a time to panic.  It's a time to act decisively. By understanding the difference between a watch and a warning, and by having a plan in place, you can dramatically increase your chances of staying safe during a tornado. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"KL divergence - AI generated Zero Shot Story VS Human story\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.011973014321672524,\n        \"min\": 0.011955016607240831,\n        \"max\": 0.03740102880219114,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.03591460772154389\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"KL divergence - AI generated Zero Shot VS AI generated with context\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.003784969547465001,\n        \"min\": 0.012118141497082607,\n        \"max\": 0.021550915354076175,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.013381975119307367\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Here\\u2019s how to make sure your seasonal fruit shines bright.\\nByClare de Boer\\nSummer berries make us all look like great bakers. Their acidity effortlessly balances sweet cake and muffin batters, their juices saturate cobbler tops and trifles, and they willingly reduce into chewy jam at the edge of crisps and crumbles.\\nRecipe:Blueberry Spoon Cake\\nI have half a mind to stop writing there, and to just let you follow any good recipe to bliss out on berries. But it\\u2019s worth understanding a few things to best unlock their delights and to not lose out if you make any substitutions. When baking calls for the same few ingredients \\u2014 butter, flour, sugar, fruit \\u2014 and spins out such varied treats, alchemy is in the details.\\nTo begin, match your berry to the baked good.Strawberries are fragile and extroverted, ready to fall apart without much cooking. Smothered in batter or baked whole, they tend to become flabby and insipid, but, cut into smaller pieces and given passage to reduce, they become syrupy and intense.\\nRaspberries are relatively dry and hold their own: They favor being scattered on top of and baked inside desserts, instead of being stewed in cobblers and crisps that want to be saucy. (Small summer blackberries also cook like raspberries.)\\nBlueberries are the most reserved of the bunch. Sprinkled into muffins and pound cakes, they keep to themselves, retaining their shape and producing sliceable, portable sweets. They need longer cooking to break their inky skins and integrate themselves into batters.\\nChoose your flour with your fruit and its juices in mind.An all-purpose white flour is most absorbent, good for bakes that need to hold their shape (pound cakes, muffins). Less absorbent flours, like whole wheat, almond meal or cornmeal, leave more fruit juices in circulation.\\nThis cornmeal cake lets the brightness of blueberries lead and encourages the fruit to surrender its juices. It calls for precooking the berries, then pouring them over a cornmeal batter. As it bakes, some blueberries sink and form a stewy bottom, while others bubble into chewy jam. The result looks like an upside-down cobbler or a muffin without its middle. It isn\\u2019t too sweet, and what it lacks in structure, it makes up for with its juiciness \\u2014 so much that it must be spooned.\\nFollowNew York Times Cooking on Instagram,Facebook,YouTube,TikTokandPinterest.Get regular updates from New York Times Cooking, with recipe suggestions, cooking tips and shopping advice.\",\n          \"Supported by\\nDealBook Newsletter\\nTesla Shareholders Will Vote on Elon Musk\\u2019s Big Payday. What Happens Then?\\nThe company has lobbied to reinstate the package awarded to Musk six years ago \\u2014 now worth about $56 billion \\u2014 after a Delaware judge voided it.\\nByMichael J. de la MercedandSarah Kessler\\nAfter months of fighting over a pay package promised to Elon Musk six years ago \\u2014 one that included stock grants now worth about $56 billion \\u2014 matters are finally coming to a head.\\nAt Tesla\\u2019s annual meeting on Thursday, shareholders are set to vote on whether to reapprove the compensation deal after aDelaware judge voided it in January. The outcome could shift Musk\\u2019s relationship with the company, and Tesla officials aren\\u2019t taking any chances.\\n\\u201cIf Tesla is to retain Elon\\u2019s attention and motivate him to continue to devote his time, energy, ambition and vision to deliver comparable results in the future, we must stand by our deal,\\u201d Robyn Denholm, the company\\u2019s chair,wrote to investorson Wednesday.\\nRegardless of the vote\\u2019s outcome, further lawsuits and other battles may follow, some of which could test the corporate legal system. Here\\u2019s our guide to how different situations could play out.\\nTesla could use shareholder approval to argue its case for Musk\\u2019s pay in court.If it wins the vote on Musk\\u2019s compensation, the company is likely to go to Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, the judge in Delaware\\u2019s Court of Chancery who rejected the compensation scheme, and argue that shareholders \\u2014 armed with the information that she said they hadn\\u2019t had when they approved the package \\u2014 have reratified the proposal. That, the company is expected to say, makes the matter moot.\\nIf McCormick declares the plan acceptable, the plaintiffs who initially sued over it are likely to appeal to Delaware\\u2019s Supreme Court. Among their potential arguments: The new vote doesn\\u2019t resolve a matter that was already decided by a judge, and shareholders\\u2019 votes may have been influenced by implied threats to Tesla\\u2019s future if the vote didn\\u2019t go Musk\\u2019s way.\",\n          \"Newsletter\\nCooking\\nPesto Pasta Bubbles!\\nThat is, pearl couscous risotto with pesto, tomatoes and mozzarella.\\nByMia Leimkuhler\\nIn Melissa Clark\\u2019s \\u201cDinner in One\\u201d cookbook \\u2014 which is her collection of one-pot recipes, you\\u2019re welcome \\u2014 Melissa shares that her family refers to pearl couscous as pasta bubbles. Pasta bubbles! Is there any better term for capturing the delightful chew and pleasingly spherical shape of this tiny pasta? (The \\u201cpasta bubbles\\u201d recipe, by the way, is for spiced pearl couscous with jammy eggplant and tomatoes, a recipe inspired bythis onefrom Adeena Sussman.)\\nBecause of this, I now keep pearl couscous in my pantry, and will be making this newcouscous risotto with tomatoes and mozzarellafrom Sheela Prakash. The couscous takes the place of the usual rice, which cuts down on cook time, increases the texture and keeps the creaminess. Use store-bought pesto or, if you\\u2019ve picked up a basil plant from the hardware store,homemade. Pasta bubbles, cherry tomatoes and bright green basil pesto \\u2014 perfectly, adorably summer.\\nFeatured Recipe\\nCouscous Risotto With Tomatoes and Mozzarella\\nView Recipe \\u2192\\nSpeaking of the season: I\\u2019ve started stockpiling pressure cooker recipes in advance of the July and August heat that keeps me away from my stove and oven. Thispressure cooker coconut curry chickenfrom Melissa caught my eye; I love the idea of a richly spiced, cardamom- and coriander-scented curry at the push of a button. (And if this \\u201clet the robots do the work, I\\u2019m going to sit in front of the AC\\u201d scenario appeals to you, you can thumb through our Instant Pot recipe collectionhere.)\\nI don\\u2019t mind turning on the stove for searing fish, though, since the cooking goes so quickly. Ali Slagle\\u2019span-seared fish with citrus pestofeatures a lemony basil pesto bumped up with pistachios and capers. The pesto is vegan and garlic-free, so it\\u2019s a good one to keep in mind for specific dietary and allergy needs as summer entertaining gets going.\\nI\\u2019ll also turn on the stove for \\u00d6zlem Warren\\u2019s\\u00e7ilbir, or Turkish poached eggs with garlicky yogurt and a drizzle of spicy butter, a recipe adapted by Alexa Weibel. I\\u2019m not usually adept (read: patient) enough for a proper, gently poached egg, so I\\u2019m pleased to report that this dish is also delicious with a runny-centered five-minute egg.\\nIt\\u2019s also time to start saving eggplant recipes. I can\\u2019t get enough of eggplants and appreciate how plentiful they are in summer. I made Eric Kim\\u2019sbulgogi eggplantthe other night for family and received raves, which felt like a cheat given how easy it is to prepare.\\nSimilarly, and to wrap things up, here\\u2019s a note from Judy Stark, a reader, on David Tanis\\u2019s newmango crumble: \\u201cThis couldn\\u2019t be easier, but it\\u2019s delicious.

There did not appear to be any immediate danger to residents on Monday.\\nByVictor Mather\\nKilauea, the most active volcano in Hawaii,began eruptingearly on Monday morning. Kilauea, in the southeast part of the Big Island, erupted three times last year.\\nBecause the eruption was happening near the summit, there did not appear to be any immediate danger to residents.\\nThe eruption began at 12:30 a.m. local time. Magma was rising from beneath the surface and \\u201cfountaining\\u201d up through cracks, the United States Geological Survey said.\\nRather than the hundreds of feet you might expect in aclassic, major volcanic eruption, Michael Poland, a geophysicist with the U.S.G.S., said the lava at Kilauea was rising only \\u201ctens of feet\\u201d on Monday.\\nU.S. Geological Survey\\nBy John Keefe\\nIn 2023, Kilauea eruptedin January,JuneandSeptember. Amajor eruption in 2018destroyed 700 homes.\\n\\u201cFrom 1983 to 2018, all of the activity came from two vents,\\u201d Mr. Poland said. \\u201cSince 2018, it has gone away from a period of steady eruptions. Now it has discrete, usually shortish eruptions happening in several different places. Now we\\u2019re getting eruptions happening in places we haven\\u2019t seen in 50 years.\\u201d\\nRecent eruptions have typically lasted six to eight hours.\\n\\u201cUnlike 2018, when lava was coming out in people\\u2019s backyards, these are in the national park,\\u201d Mr. Poland said, referring to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.\\nThe volcano alert level was raised Monday to a warning from a watch, the normal move when an eruption starts.\\nScientists had been watching for an eruption after about 250 earthquakes were recorded beneath Kilauea\\u2019s summit over an eight-hour period before the eruption.\\nEarthquakes are sometimes a precursor to eruption. The strongest quake was a magnitude-4.1 temblor at 9:12 p.m., about three hours before the eruption.\\nThe U.S.G.S. said that during Kilauea\\u2019s eruptions, volcanic gas, including sulfur dioxide, is released. That gas reacts in the atmosphere to create volcanic smog, or vog.\\n\\u201cVog creates the potential for airborne health hazards to residents and visitors, damages agricultural crops and other plants, and affects livestock,\\u201d the agency said.\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s more of an irritant,\\u201d Mr. Poland said. \\u201cIf people have sensitive breathing or respiratory issues, they may find it more difficult to breathe.\\u201d\\nMr. Poland said after the initial eruptions, the activity was starting to wane as of 11 a.m. Eastern time. \\u201cWe wouldn\\u2019t expect this one to be a terribly long-term eruption,\\u201d he said.\\nVictor Mather, who has been a reporter and editor at The Times for 25 years, covers sports and breaking news.More about Victor Mather\",\n          \"Supported by\\nStrasbourg for Book Lovers\\nBibliophiles will find plenty of centuries-old tomes, graphic novels, modern works and more in this French city, which also happens to be this year\\u2019s UNESCO World Book Capital.\\nBySeth Sherwood\\nAttention, bibliophiles: Put Strasbourg, the largest city in eastern France, on your radar. Once home to the godfather of publishing \\u2014 the 15th-centuryprinting-press pioneer Johannes Gutenberg\\u2014 the city is theUNESCO World Book Capitalfor 2024. Through next April, more than 200events and activitieswill take place in and around Strasbourg, a polyglot city on the German border whose half-timbered gingerbread houses, gabled roofs, picturesque canals and church spires seem to have sprung from a storybook of their own.\\nAmong the events are exhibitions devoted toGustave Dor\\u00e9\\u2014 a Strasbourg native and perhaps the 19th-century\\u2019s most celebrated illustrator of literary works \\u2014 andJulie Doucet, a groundbreaking Quebec graphic novelist and visual artist. The annualF\\u00eate des Imprimeurson June 29 and 30 in Place Gutenberg will showcase all of the trades involved in bookmaking, including through interactive workshops.\\nBut the UNESCO events aren\\u2019t the only reasons to visit. Strasbourg has many spots for the literary-minded that are permanent fixtures, fromcomic shopsandindie book emporiumstohistorical librariesandantiquarian specialists. Here are six favorites.\\nPlace Gutenberg: The story begins\\nA native of Mainz, Germany (about 100 miles away), Gutenberg lived in Strasbourg in the 1430s and 1440s, developing the initial plans for his revolutionary moveable-type printing press, which would come to fruition in Mainz in the 1450s.\\nTo honor him, Strasbourg in 1840 erected a statue in a square near the city\\u2019s red sandstone cathedral, whose Gothic design another German visitor, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, famously rhapsodized about. (The future literary star studied in Strasbourg in the early 1770s, living nearby at 36 rue du Vieux-March\\u00e9-aux-Poissons.)\",\n          \"Supported by\\nCan A.I. Rethink Art? Should It?\\nThere is an increasing overlap between art and artificial intelligence. Some celebrate it, while others worry.\\nByFarah Nayeri\\nReporting from Venice\\nThe skeleton seems to be at the epicenter of a mystifying ritual.\\nIn a new work by the French artist Pierre Huyghe, robots powered by artificial intelligence film the unburied remains of a man, and periodically position objects next to it in a ceremony that only they seem to understand. The scene takes place in the Atacama Desert in Chile, one of the planet\\u2019s oldest and driest deserts.\\n\\u201cCamata\\u201d ison viewat the Punta della Dogana \\u2013 Pinault Collection exhibition space, in a show concurrent with the Venice Biennale (through Nov. 24). It\\u2019s a stirring example of the increasing overlap between art and artificial intelligence, or A.I.\\nThose two vowels, placed side by side, seem to present a menace to many disciplines whose practitioners risk being replaced by smart and autonomous machines. Humanity itself could, at some future point, be replaced by superintelligent machines, according to some globally renowned thinkers and philosophers such as the Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari and Stephen Hawking.\\nSo why are artists dabbling with A.I.? And do they risk being extinguished by it?\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s always been an attraction, on the part of artists, for chance: something which is beyond your own control, something that liberates you from the finite subject,\\u201d said Daniel Birnbaum, a curator who is the artistic director of the digital art production platform Acute Art and a panelist at the Art for Tomorrow conference here this week convened by the Democracy & Culture Foundation with panels moderated by New York Times journalists.\\nBirnbaum said that Huyghe was among the artists who \\u2014 rather than \\u201coverwhelming us with A.I.-generated nonsense from the internet\\u201d \\u2014 are interested in exploring \\u201cplaces where nature and artificiality merge,\\u201d and where \\u201cbiological systems and artificial systems somehow collaborate, creating visually strange things.\\u201d\\nIn the world at large, Birnbaum acknowledged, there were \\u201cfrightening scenarios\\u201d whereby artificially intelligent systems could control decisions made by governments or the military, and pose grave threats to humanity.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
